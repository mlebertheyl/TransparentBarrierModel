# Code description:
## Old

Code before we decided to chanege 
### 1. Functions
All the necessary functions to run the R code.

### 2. Steps
Toy example to illustrate the steps we would follow in a real life example to build the barrier model. Mainly getting the range fraction to plug in the barrier model.

## 3. two rb
Toy example when we have more than one barrier.

### 4. Examples
More geometry examples, with canals, etc.

Has:
+ Example 3
+ Example4.Rmd 
+ sq example.Rmd
+ sq^2 example.Rmd

### 5. Poisson

#### Poisson data with toy mesh Example

Mesh here is built in the same way as previous examples (BTopic103). However, data is simulated as if it was a Poisson process (SPDE book).

#### Poisson data with Poisson mesh Example.

The mesh built here is done according to what I would do in a real life application for point processes. The data is simulated as if it was a Poisson process (it's the same as previous example).

### 7. Discussion 

Has the discussions of the other files altogether 

## New Files

Relevant code using new definition of transparency
