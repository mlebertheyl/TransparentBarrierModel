	abstract = {Reef fishes are an exceptionally speciose vertebrate assemblage, yet the main drivers of their diversification remain unclear. It has been suggested that Miocene reef rearrangements promoted opportunities for lineage diversification, however, the specific mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we assemble near-complete reef fish phylogenies to assess the importance of ecological and geographical factors in explaining lineage origination patterns. We reveal that reef fish diversification is strongly associated with species' trophic identity and body size. Large-bodied herbivorous fishes outpace all other trophic groups in recent diversification rates, a pattern that is consistent through time. Additionally, we show that omnivory acts as an intermediate evolutionary step between higher and lower trophic levels, while planktivory represents a common transition destination. Overall, these results suggest that Miocene changes in reef configurations were likely driven by, and subsequently promoted, trophic innovations. This highlights trophic evolution as a key element in enhancing reef fish diversification.},

	abstract = {Past environmental changes are expected to have profoundly impacted diversity dynamics through time. While some previous studies showed an association between past climate changes or tectonic events and important shifts in lineage diversification, it is only recently that past environmental changes have been explicitly integrated in diversification models to test their influence on diversification rates. Here, we used a global reconstruction of tropical reef habitat dynamics during the Cenozoic and phylogenetic diversification models to test the influence of (i) major geological events, (ii) reef habitat fragmentation and (iii) reef area on the diversification of 9 major clades of tropical reef fish (Acanthuridae, Balistoidea, Carangoidea, Chaetodontidae, Haemulinae, Holocentridae, Labridae, Pomacentridae and Sparidae). The diversification models revealed a weak association between paleo-habitat changes and diversification dynamics. Specifically, the fragmentation of tropical reef habitats over the Cenozoic was found to be a driver of tropical reef fish diversification for 2 clades. However, overall, our approach did not allow the identification of striking associations between diversification dynamics and paleo-habitat fragmentation in contrast with theoretical model's predictions.},

            The states of past climate
            
              Deep-sea benthic foraminifera preserve an essential record of Earth's past climate in their oxygen- and carbon-isotope compositions. However, this record lacks sufficient temporal resolution and/or age control in some places to determine which climate forcing and feedback mechanisms were most important. Westerhold
              et al.
              present a highly resolved and well-dated record of benthic carbon and oxygen isotopes for the past 66 million years. Their reconstruction and analysis show that Earth's climate can be grouped into discrete states separated by transitions related to changing greenhouse gas levels and the growth of polar ice sheets. Each climate state is paced by orbital cycles but responds to variations in radiative forcing in a state-dependent manner.

            Much of our understanding of Earth's past climate comes from the measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Yet, long intervals in existing records lack the temporal resolution and age control needed to thoroughly categorize climate states of the Cenozoic era and to study their dynamics. Here, we present a new, highly resolved, astronomically dated, continuous composite of benthic foraminifer isotope records developed in our laboratories. Four climate states---Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, Icehouse---are identified on the basis of their distinctive response to astronomical forcing depending on greenhouse gas concentrations and polar ice sheet volume. Statistical analysis of the nonlinear behavior encoded in our record reveals the key role that polar ice volume plays in the predictability of Cenozoic climate dynamics.},

	abstract = {The fossil record acts as a time machine, providing data on the morphology, ecology and biogeography of ancient species. Therefore, ideally, fossil data should be included in evolutionary, macroecological and biogeographical studies. However, paleontological data are often not used in biological research, in part because of the difficulty of extracting occurrence records from the primary literature. The goal of the Paleobiology Database is to make these records generally accessible, but unlike databases such as Genbank and GBIF, a ready-made interface to the R computing environment has not been available. We have developed paleobioDB, an R package designed to perform easy and flexible queries of the Paleobiology Database, including visualization, downloading and processing of selected data. This package facilitates access to paleontological data in a way that should allow further analysis using other packages and libraries available in R. The paleobioDB package should facilitate the integration of paleontological and neontological datasets, so that data from the deep past can be used to help inform our understanding of living biota, and vice versa.},

@article{wirsing_living_2007,
	abstract = {When threatened with predation, foraging prey can cease feeding and seek refuge or shift to feeding sites (microhabitats) offering increased safety. Predator-induced microhabitat shifts by large herbivores are of interest to ecologists because spatial patterns of foraging by these animals shape plant communities. The influence of predation risk on microhabitat use by large herbivores in marine systems remains poorly understood. We explored the relationship between microhabitat use by dugongs, Dugong dugon, and tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier, predation risk in an Australian embayment over 3 years. Use by foraging dugongs of two seagrass microhabitats, edge (lower-quality seagrass, swift escape from sharks) and interior (higher-quality seagrass, fewer escape options), was monitored in seven survey zones. We indexed predation danger using catch rates of tiger sharks that were greater than 3.0m in total length. The degree of dissimilarity between forager densities in edge and interior microhabitats was a function of tiger shark abundance: foragers underused edge (safe) microhabitat when sharks were scarce, overused it when sharks were common, and responded to daily changes in shark abundance in a threat-sensitive fashion, showing the greatest preference for edges when shark abundance was highest. We conclude that dugongs manage their probability of death by allocating more time to safe but lower-quality feeding microhabitats when the likelihood of encountering sharks is elevated. Dugong grazing can influence seagrass biomass and patch composition, so tiger sharks probably affect the microhabitat structure of seagrass meadows, and ultimately their benthic communities, indirectly by altering the way that dugongs use feeding patches.},

@article{sheppard_effects_2009,
	abstract = {Quantifying the factors influencing behaviors of aquatic mammalian grazers may enhance the generic understanding of grazer ecology. We investigated diel and tidal patterns in movements of the dugong (Dugong dugon) by Global Positioning System--tracking 12 animals in 5 inshore--intertidal and 3 offshore--subtidal habitats along the coast of Queensland, Australia. We examined effects of tide height and time of day on the dugong's distance from 1) the nearest coast, 2) water {\textgreater}3 m deep, 3) actual water depth (bathymetry tide ht) experienced, and 4) distribution of the directions of movements. Both tidal and diel cycles influenced dugong movement. Tracked dugongs tended to be closer to shore at high tide than at low tide and closer to shore at night than during the day. Onshore movement was more prevalent on incoming tides and in the afternoon and evening. Offshore movement was more prevalent on outgoing tides and from midnight through the morning until midday. Tidal and diel variation in water depths used by the inshore--intertidal dugongs was small, but probably underestimated, hidden by a sampling bias in the telemetry equipment. Onshore movement at high tide allowed dugongs to exploit intertidal seagrass beds. Dugongs are closer to shore in afternoons and evenings than in mornings. This behavior may be related to the avoidance of predators or watercraft. Our findings can be used to predict spatial patterns of dugongs within areas of conservation management significance and to assess, avoid, and mitigate adverse effects of anthropogenic disturbance.},

@article{wirsing_fear_2007,
	abstract = {Predators can influence plants indirectly by altering spatial patterns of herbivory, so studies assessing the relationship between perceived predation risk and habitat use by herbivores may improve our understanding of community organization. In marine systems, the effects of predation danger on space use by large herbivores have received little attention, despite the possibility that predator-mediated alterations in patterns of grazing by these animals influence benthic community structure. We evaluated the relationship between habitat use by foraging dugongs (Dugong dugon) and the threat of tiger shark predation in an Australian embayment (Shark Bay) between 1997 and 2004. Dugong densities were quantified in shallow (putatively dangerous) and deep (putatively safe) habitats (seven survey zones allocated to each habitat), and predation hazard was indexed using catch rates of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier); seagrass volume provided a measure of food biomass within each zone. Overall, dugongs selected shallow habitats, where their food is concentrated. Foragers used shallow and deep habitats in proportion to food availability (input matching) when large tiger sharks were scarce and overused deep habitats when sharks were common. Furthermore, strong synchrony existed between daily measures of shark abundance and the extent to which deep habitats were overused. Thus, dugongs appear to adaptively manage their risk of death by allocating time to safe but impoverished foraging patches in proportion to the likelihood of encountering predators in profitable but more dangerous areas. This apparent food-safety trade-off has important implications for seagrass community structure in Shark Bay, as it may result in marked temporal variability in grazing pressure.},

@article{wirsing_behavioural_2012,
	abstract = {Although not widely appreciated, prey can manage predation risk by modifying the sequence of their behavioural states. We explored this phenomenon in dugongs (Dugong dugon) subject to spatially and temporally variable risk of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) predation in Shark Bay, Australia. Dugong behaviour was assayed using focal follows and organised into sequences of foraging, resting, and travelling bouts. We used log-linear analysis to test for sequence differences in relation to habitat (deep, shallow) and predation danger (sharks present, largely absent). Dugongs modified their behavioural sequences between periods of high and low shark abundance: those at risk alternated more frequently between foraging, which constrains anti-predator vigilance, and travelling, which facilitates predator detection. Dugongs also avoided continuous series of resting bouts, during which awareness is reduced, when sharks were present. These changes were only observed in relatively dangerous shallow habitat, which is hunted disproportionately by tiger sharks; behavioural responses to sharks in deep habitat were modest. We conclude that dugongs in risky habitat resort to safer behavioural sequences in response to sharks. Given that human disturbance and predators are perceived similarly by many species, some forms of vessel interaction could compromise the fitness of sirenians by eliciting similar behavioural adjustment.},

@article{heithaus_towards_2009,
	abstract = {1 Risk effects of predators can profoundly affect community dynamics, but the nature of these effects is context dependent. 2 Although context dependence has hindered the development of a general framework for predicting the nature and extent of risk effects, recent studies suggest that such a framework is attainable if the factors that shape anti-predator behaviour, and its effectiveness, in natural communities are well understood. 3 One of these factors, the interaction of prey escape tactics and landscape features, has been largely overlooked. 4 We tested whether this interaction gives rise to interspecific variation in habitat-use patterns of sympatric large marine vertebrates at risk of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron and LeSueur, 1822) predation. Specifically, we tested the a priori hypothesis that pied cormorants (Phalacrocorax varius Gmelin, 1789) would modify their use of shallow seagrass habitats in a manner opposite to that of previously studied dolphins (Tursiops aduncus Ehrenberg, 1833), dugongs (Dugong dugon M{\"u}ller, 1776), and green turtles (Chelonia mydas Linnaeus, 1758) because, unlike these species, the effectiveness of cormorant escape behaviour does not vary spatially. 5 As predicted, cormorants used interior and edge portions of banks proportional to the abundance of their potential prey when sharks were absent but shifted to interior portions of banks to minimize encounters with tiger sharks as predation risk increased. Other shark prey, however, shift to edge microhabitats when shark densities increase to take advantage of easier escape despite higher encounter rates with sharks. 6 The interaction of landscape features and escape ability likely is important in diverse communities. 7 When escape probabilities are high in habitats with high predator density, risk effects of predators can reverse the direction of commonly assumed indirect effects of top predators. 8 The interaction between landscape features and prey escape tactics can result in a single predator species having differential effects on their sympatric prey that could cascade through ecosystems and should be incorporated into a general framework for context dependence of risk effects.},

	abstract = {The estimation of origination and extinction rates and their temporal variation is central to understanding diversity patterns and the evolutionary history of clades. The fossil record provides the only direct evidence of extinction and biodiversity changes through time and has long been used to infer the dynamics of diversity changes in deep time. The software PyRate implements a Bayesian framework to analyze fossil occurrence data to estimate the rates of preservation, origination, and extinction while incorporating several sources of uncertainty. Building upon this framework, we present a suite of methodological advances including more complex and realistic models of preservation and the first likelihood-based test to compare the fit across different models. Further, we develop a new reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate origination and extinction rates and their temporal variation, which provides more reliable results and includes an explicit estimation of the number and temporal placement of statistically significant rate changes. Finally, we implement a new C++ library that speeds up the analyses by orders of magnitude, therefore facilitating the application of the PyRate methods to large data sets. We demonstrate the new functionalities through extensive simulations and with the analysis of a large data set of Cenozoic marine mammals. We compare our analytical framework against two widely used alternative methods to infer origination and extinction rates, revealing that PyRate decisively outperforms them across a range of simulated data sets. Our analyses indicate that explicit statistical model testing, which is often neglected in fossil-based macroevolutionary analyses, is crucial to obtain accurate and robust results.},

	abstract = {Despite the advancement of phylogenetic methods to estimate speciation and extinction rates, their power can be limited under variable rates, in particular for clades with high extinction rates and small number of extant species. Fossil data can provide a powerful alternative source of information to investigate diversification processes. Here, we present PyRate, a computer program to estimate speciation and extinction rates and their temporal dynamics from fossil occurrence data. The rates are inferred in a Bayesian framework and are comparable to those estimated from phylogenetic trees. We describe how PyRate can be used to explore different models of diversification. In addition to the diversification rates, it provides estimates of the parameters of the preservation process (fossilization and sampling) and the times of speciation and extinction of each species in the data set. Moreover, we develop a new birth--death model to correlate the variation of speciation/extinction rates with changes of a continuous trait. Finally, we demonstrate the use of Bayes factors for model selection and show how the posterior estimates of a PyRate analysis can be used to generate calibration densities for Bayesian molecular clock analysis. PyRate is an open-source command-line Python program available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyrate/.},

We build on the recent literature by developing a framework to describe the effects these changes will have on marine megafauna. With the goal to assist policymakers and grass roots organizers, we identify three illustrative pathways by which climate change drives these range shifts: (1) effects on habitat and shelter, (2) impacts on reproduction and disease, and (3) changing distribution of sources of food. We examine non-climate factors that may constrain or enable megafauna to adapt, creating winners and losers both for the species and the people dependent upon them. Finally, we comment on what management strategies exist at international and local scales that could help mitigate these impacts of climate change so that we, as a global community, can ensure that marine megafauna and people can best co-exist in a changing world.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to analyze the distribution of manatees, dolphins and sea turtles off northeastern Brazil through aerial surveys, relating them to specific habitats and human activities, with emphasis on marine protected areas (MPAs). Surveys were conducted between January and April 2010 at 150 m altitude and 140 km h{\`A}1, using two independent observers. Strip transects were flown in a zigzag pattern. Transects covered 4026 km in more than 27 flight hours. A total of 36 sightings of manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus, 41 individuals), 28 of dolphins (Delphinidae, 78 individuals, including 10 Sotalia guianensis) and 256 of sea turtles (Cheloniidae, 286 individuals) were recorded. Manatees and sea turtles displayed solitary habits, while dolphins were commonly seen in groups. Manatees were positively correlated with sea turtles, probably due to their preference for sheltered shallow habitats with favorable conditions for foraging and resting. Furthermore, manatees showed a positive relationship with mangrove estuaries, and medium-sized coastal cities probably due to the intense urban development in many estuarine areas. Manatees and sea turtles were also positively correlated with boats, showing a severe threat for these species. Density of manatees was significantly higher within MPAs with preserved mangrove estuaries than in non-protected areas, while dolphins and sea turtles were observed in high densities MPAs with coral reefs. The elevated density of these organisms shows the vital importance of protecting and adequately managing unique ecosystems to ensure a sustainable future for the populations of severely threatened species.},

@article{dunshea_observer_2020,
	abstract = {Aerial survey methods for census of wildlife populations are widely used to manage species. There has been considerable research to develop methods to cope with imperfect detection during aerial surveys, however misidentification remains an unresolved but significant issue. Using data from a comprehensive dugong aerial survey of the coastline of the Northern Territory, Australia, we assessed the influence of observer, sighting and environmental variables on probabilities of both observers in double-count, dual-observer teams detecting dugongs and dolphins (`duplicate sighting probability'), the confidence with which observers could distinguish between dugongs and dolphins, and the reliability of post-detection observations by comparing data between observers. Dolphin duplicate sighting probability varied dependent on group size, Beaufort sea state and the lateral position inside the strip-width transect in relation to the aircraft. Dugong duplicate sighting probability varied across dual-observer teams. Counts of individuals in dugong and dolphin groups were unreliable past ≈5 individuals. Observer confidence in taxon identification varied by individual observer and throughout the duration of the survey (dolphin sightings) and potentially by the lateral position inside the transect strip-width in relation to the aircraft (dugong sightings). The probability of taxon identification disagreement between observers for duplicate dugong and dolphin sightings varied with group size, and markedly if one observer was uncertain (i.e. not 100\% confident) of their assigned taxon. We believe this is predominately due to the presence of Australian snubfin dolphins (Orcaella heinsohni) in the survey area, which look like dugongs when seen from a distance, momentarily. We further show that application of different data filtering scenarios for uncertain taxonomic identifications and taxon identification disagreements between dual observers produces highly variable estimates of observer-specific dugong detection probability (ranging from 0.26 to 0.80 in a single observer) and dugong abundance (x̅ $\pm$ S.D., 40\% $\pm$ 25\%: difference between highest and lowest estimate, relative to the lowest estimate, across different data filtering scenarios). These results are particularly relevant not only to researchers conducting dugong aerial surveys, but also for other marine mammal aerial surveys in passing mode that target sympatric, morphologically similar species. We recommend development of operating procedures and analytical methods to quantify and adjust for misidentification and uncertain taxon identifications.},

Regular surveys are used to this purpose followed often by a manual counting process. This paper proposes an algorithm for automatic detection of dugongs from imagery taken in aerial surveys. Our algorithm exploits the fact that dugongs are rare in most images, therefore we determine regions of interest partially based on color rarity. This simple observation makes the system robust to changes in illumination. We also show that by applying the extended-maxima transform on red-ratio images, submerged dugongs with very fuzzy edges can be detected. Performance figures obtained here are promising in terms of degree of confidence in the detection of marine species, but more importantly our approach represents a significant step in automating this type of surveys.},

We explore the relationships between the proportion of sea cows (Dugong dugon) classified as calves and four climatic drivers (rainfall anomaly, Southern Oscillation El Ni{\~n}o Index [SOI], NINO 3.4 sea surface temperature index, and number of tropical cyclones) at a range of spatially distinct locations in Queensland, Australia, a region with relatively high dugong density. Dugong and calf data were obtained from standardized aerial surveys conducted along the study region. A range of lagged versions of each of the focal climatic drivers (1 to 4 years) were included in a global model containing the proportion of calves in each population crossed with each of the lagged versions of the climatic drivers to explore relationships. The relative influence of each predictor was estimated via Gibbs variable selection. The relationships between the proportion of dependent calves and the climatic drivers varied spatially and temporally, with climatic drivers influencing calf counts at sub-regional scales. Thus we recommend that the assessment of and management response to indirect climatic threats on dugongs should also occur at sub-regional scales.},

@article{hodgson_unmanned_2013,
	abstract = {Aerial surveys of marine mammals are routinely conducted to assess and monitor species' habitat use and population status. In Australia, dugongs (Dugong dugon) are regularly surveyed and long-term datasets have formed the basis for defining habitat of high conservation value and risk assessments of human impacts. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may facilitate more accurate, human-risk free, and cheaper aerial surveys. We undertook the first Australian UAV survey trial in Shark Bay, western Australia. We conducted seven flights of the ScanEagle UAV, mounted with a digital SLR camera payload. During each flight, ten transects covering a 1.3 km2 area frequently used by dugongs, were flown at 500, 750 and 1000 ft. Image (photograph) capture was controlled via the Ground Control Station and the capture rate was scheduled to achieve a prescribed 10\% overlap between images along transect lines. Images were manually reviewed post hoc for animals and scored according to sun glitter, Beaufort Sea state and turbidity. We captured 6243 images, 627 containing dugongs. We also identified whales, dolphins, turtles and a range of other fauna. Of all possible dugong sightings, 95\% (CI = 90\%, 98\%) were subjectively classed as `certain' (unmistakably dugongs). Neither our dugong sighting rate, nor our ability to identify dugongs with certainty, were affected by UAV altitude. Turbidity was the only environmental variable significantly affecting the dugong sighting rate. Our results suggest that UAV systems may not be limited by sea state conditions in the same manner as sightings from manned surveys. The overlap between images proved valuable for detecting animals that were masked by sun glitter in the corners of images, and identifying animals initially captured at awkward body angles. This initial trial of a basic camera system has successfully demonstrated that the ScanEagle UAV has great potential as a tool for marine mammal aerial surveys.},

	abstract = {Seagrasses are hugely valuable to human life, but the global extent of seagrass meadows remains unclear. As evidence of their value, a United Nations program exists (http://data. unep-wcmc.org/datasets/7) to try and assess their distribution and there has been a call from 122 scientists across 28 countries for more work to manage, protect and monitor seagrass meadows (http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37606827). Emerging from the 12th International Seagrass Biology Workshop, held in October 2016, has been the view that grazing marine megafauna may play a useful role in helping to identify previously unknown seagrass habitats. Here we describe this concept, showing how detailed information on the distribution of both dugongs (Dugong dugon) and green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) obtained, for example, by aerial surveys and satellite tracking, can reveal new information on the location of seagrass meadows. We show examples of how marine megaherbivores have been effective habitat indicators, revealing major, new, deep-water seagrass meadows and offering the potential for more informed estimates of seagrass extent in tropical and sub-tropical regions where current information is often lacking.},

	abstract = {Changes in the relative abundance of marine megafauna (whales, dolphins, sharks, turtles, manta rays, dugongs) from aerial survey sightings in the waters adjacent to Ningaloo Reef between June 2000 and April 2002 are described. Generalised linear models were used to explore relationships between different trophic guilds of animals (based on animal sighting biomass estimates) and biophysical features of the oceanscape that were likely to indicate foraging habitats (regions of primary/secondary production) including sea surface temperature (SST), SST gradient, chlorophylla (Chl-a), bathymetry (BTH) and bathymetry gradient (BTHg). Relative biomass of krill feeders (i.e. minke whales, whale sharks, manta rays) were related to SST, Chl-a and bathymetry (model [AICc] weight = 0.45) and the model combining these variables explained a relatively large amount (32.3\%) of the variation in relative biomass. Relative biomass of fish/cephalopod feeders (dolphins, sharks) were weakly correlated with changes in SST, whereas that of other invertebrate/macroalgal feeders (turtles, dugong) was weakly correlated with changes in steepness of the shelf (bathymetry gradient). Our results indicate that biophysical variables describe only a small proportion of the variance in the relative abundance and biomass of marine megafauna at Ningaloo reef.},

@article{martin_combining_2015,
	abstract = {Monitoring abundance and distribution of organisms over large landscapes can be difficult. Because of challenges associated with logistics and data analyses uncorrected counts are often used as a proxy for abundance. We present the first statewide estimate of abundance for Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) using an innovative approach that combines multiple sources of information. We used a combination of a double-observer protocol, repeated passes, and collection of detailed diving behavior data to account for imperfect detection of animals. Our estimate of manatee abundance was 6350 (95\%CI: 5310--7390). Specifically, we estimated 2790 (95\%CI: 2160--3540) manatees on the west coast (2011), and 3560 (95\%CI: 2850--4410) on the east coast (2012). Unlike uncorrected counts conducted since 1991, our estimation method considered two major sources of error: spatial variation in distribution and imperfect detection. The Florida manatee is listed as endangered, but its status is currently under review; the present study may become important for the review process. Interestingly, we estimated that 70\% (95\%CI: 60--80\%) of manatees on the east coast of Florida were aggregated in one county during our survey. Our study illustrates the value of combining information from multiple sources to monitor abundance at large scales. Integration of information can reduce cost, facilitate the use of data obtained from new technologies to increase accuracy, and contribute to encouraging coordination among survey teams from different organizations nationally or internationally. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our work to other conservation applications (e.g., risk assessment) and to other systems.},

@article{hammond_estimating_2021,
	abstract = {Motivated by the need to estimate the abundance of marine mammal populations to inform conservation assessments, especially relating to fishery bycatch, this paper provides background on abundance estimation and reviews the various methods available for pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians. We first give an ``entrylevel'' introduction to abundance estimation, including fundamental concepts and the importance of recognizing sources of bias and obtaining a measure of precision. Each of the primary methods available to estimate abundance of marine mammals is then described, including data collection and analysis, common challenges in implementation, and the assumptions made, violation of which can lead to bias. The main method for estimating pinniped abundance is extrapolation of counts of animals (pups or all-ages) on land or ice to the whole population. Cetacean and sirenian abundance is primarily estimated from transect surveys conducted from ships, small boats or aircraft. If individuals of a species can be recognized from natural markings, mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data can be used to estimate the number of animals using the study area. Throughout, we cite example studies that illustrate the methods described. To estimate the abundance of a marine mammal population, key issues include: defining the population to be estimated, considering candidate methods based on strengths and weaknesses in relation to a range of logistical and practical issues, being aware of the resources required to collect and analyze the data, and understanding the assumptions made. We conclude with a discussion of some practical issues, given the various challenges that arise during implementation.},

            Brandon, J. R., Breiwick, J. M., Punt, A. E., and Wade, P. R. 2007. Constructing a coherent joint prior while respecting biological realism: application to marine mammal stock assessments. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 1085--1100. Bayesian estimation methods, employing the Sampling--Importance--Resampling algorithm, are currently used to perform stock assessments for several stocks of marine mammals, including the Bering--Chukchi--Beaufort Seas stock of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) off Greenland. However, owing to the functional relationships among parameters in deterministic age-structured population dynamics models, placing explicit priors on each life history parameter in addition to the population growth rate parameter results in an incoherent joint prior distribution (i.e. two different priors on the estimated parameters). One solution to constructing a coherent joint prior is to solve for juvenile survival analytically, using values generated from the prior distributions for the remaining parameters. However, certain combinations of model parameter values result in values for juvenile survival that are larger than adult survival, which is biologically implausible. Therefore, to respect biological realism, certain parameter values must be rejected for some or all the remaining parameters. This study investigates several alternative resampling schemes for obtaining a realistic joint prior distribution, given the constraint on survival rates. The sensitivity of assessment results is investigated for data-rich (bowhead) and data-poor (walrus) scenarios. The results based on limited data are especially sensitive to the choice of alternative resampling scheme.},

@article{orgeret_robust_2014,
	abstract = {Estimating population trends for long-lived, migratory animals is challenging but essential for managing populations. Here we propose using a simple but potentially robust method, the direct estimation of population growth rate (PGR) from capture−recapture data. We considered an Endangered population of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae breeding and calving annually in the southern lagoon of New Caledonia. Studied since 1996, this population is known to exhibit a strong signal of transience, i.e. the presence of individuals that pass through the sampling area once, inducing detection heterogeneity. Another difficulty is that a more recently discovered second breeding and calving habitat (offshore seamounts to the south) has been surveyed with less intensity. Current direct PGR estimation models cannot deal with spatial sampling heterogeneity. In order to assess the reliability of the proposed method --- in general and for our population in particular --- we evaluated its robustness using simulations: first, when there are transient individuals; then, when the study area is split into 2 unequally sampled parts. We found no bias in PGR in the presence of transients. The bias with 2 unequally sampled parts depends on the amount and direction of exchanges, but appears negligible in our case study. The constant yearly PGR of the New Caledonian humpback whale population at the level of the 2 habitats was estimated at 1.15 (95\% CI 1.11−1.20), suggesting outside recruitment. Whenever capture−recapture is feasible, we recommend the Pradel approach to estimate the PGR, validated with appropriate simulations, in order to assess population welfare.},

@article{gunner_dead-reckoning_2021,
	abstract = {Background:  Fine-scale data on animal position are increasingly enabling us to understand the details of animal movement ecology and dead-reckoning, a technique integrating motion sensor-derived information on heading and speed, can be used to reconstruct fine-scale movement paths at sub-second resolution, irrespective of the environ‑ment. On its own however, the dead-reckoning process is prone to cumulative errors, so that position estimates quickly become uncoupled from true location. Periodic ground-truthing with aligned location data (e.g., from global positioning technology) can correct for this drift between Verified Positions (VPs). We present step-by-step instruc‑tions for implementing Verified Position Correction (VPC) dead-reckoning in R using the tilt-compensated compass method, accompanied by the mathematical protocols underlying the code and improvements and extensions of this technique to reduce the trade-off between VPC rate and dead-reckoning accuracy. These protocols are all built into a user-friendly, fully annotated VPC dead-reckoning R function; Gundog.Tracks, with multi-functionality to reconstruct animal movement paths across terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial systems, provided within the Additional file 4 as well as online (GitHub).
Results: The Gundog.Tracks function is demonstrated on three contrasting model species (the African lion Panthera leo, the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, and the Imperial cormorant Leucocarbo atriceps) moving on land, in water and in air. We show the effect of uncorrected errors in speed estimations, heading inaccuracies and infrequent VPC rate and demonstrate how these issues can be addressed.
Conclusions:  The function provided will allow anyone familiar with R to dead-reckon animal tracks readily and accu‑rately, as the key complex issues are dealt with by Gundog.Tracks. This will help the community to consider and imple‑ment a valuable, but often overlooked method of reconstructing high-resolution animal movement paths across diverse species and systems without requiring a bespoke application.},

              The massively accelerated biodiversity loss rate in the Anthropocene calls for an efficient and effective way to identify the spatial and temporal dynamics of endangered species. To this end, we developed a useful identification framework based on a case study of locally endangered
              Sousa chinensis

              in the estuaries of eastern Guangdong that had previously been neglected, which could guide the future study and conservation. Based on the statistical testing of reported spatial and temporal dolphins sighting data from fishermen and the ecological monitoring analyses, including sighting rate, site fidelity and residence time estimations, some of the current
              Sousa chinensis
              units are likely to be geographically isolated and critically endangered, which calls for much greater conservation efforts. Given the accelerated population extinction rate and increasing budgetary constraints, our survey pattern can be applied in a timely and economically acceptable manner to the spatial and temporal assessment of other threatened coastal delphinids, particularly when population distributions are on a large scale and traditional sampling methods are difficult to implement.},

Ferns comprise a major terrestrial plant radiation with an extensive evolutionary history providing a wealth of modern and fossil data for modelling environmental drivers of diversification. Here we develop a novel Bayesian model to simultaneously estimate correlations between diversification dynamics and multiple environmental trajectories. We estimate the impact of different factors on fern diversification over the past 400 million years by analysing a comprehensive dataset of fossil occurrences and complement these findings by analysing a large molecular phylogeny. We show that origination and extinction rates are governed by fundamentally different processes: originations depend on within-group diversity but are largely unaffected by environmental changes, whereas extinctions are strongly affected by external factors such as climate and geology. Our results indicate that the prime driver of fern diversity dynamics is environmentally driven extinction, with origination being an opportunistic response to diminishing ecospace occupancy.},

	abstract = {We review Phanerozoic sea-level changes [543 million years ago (Ma) to the present] on various time scales and present a new sea-level record for the past 100 million years (My). Long-term sea level peaked at 100 $\pm$ 50 meters during the Cretaceous, implying that ocean-crust production rates were much lower than previously inferred. Sea level mirrors oxygen isotope variations, reflecting ice-volume change on the 104- to 106-year scale, but a link between oxygen isotope and sea level on the 107-year scale must be due to temperature changes that we attribute to tectonically controlled carbon dioxide variations. Sea-level change has influenced phytoplankton evolution, ocean chemistry, and the loci of carbonate, organic carbon, and siliciclastic sediment burial. Over the past 100 My, sea-level changes reflect global climate evolution from a time of ephemeral Antarctic ice sheets (100 to 33 Ma), through a time of large ice sheets primarily in Antarctica (33 to 2.5 Ma), to a world with large Antarctic and large, variable Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (2.5 Ma to the present).},

@article{alroy_four_2020,
	abstract = {The choice of measures used to estimate the richness of species, genera, or higher taxa is a crucial matter in paleobiology and ecology. This paper evaluates four methods called shareholder quorum subsampling, true richness estimated using a Poisson sampling model (TRiPS), squares, and the corrected first-order jackknife (cJ1). Quorum subsampling interpolates to produce a relative richness estimate, while the other three extrapolate to the size of the overall species pool. Here I use routine ecological data to show that squares and cJ1 pass several basic validation tests, but TRiPS does not. First, TRiPS estimates are insensitive to the shape of abundance distributions, being entirely predicted by total counts of species and of individuals regardless of the details. Furthermore, TRiPS tends not to extrapolate at all when sampling is moderate or intense. Second, all three extrapolators yield lower values when they work with small uniform subsamples of large raw inventories. The third test is a split-analyze-and-sum analysis: each inventory is divided between the most common and least common halves of the abundance distribution, the methods are applied to the half-inventories, and the estimates are summed. Squares and cJ1 perform well here, but TRiPS does not extrapolate as long as the full inventories are reasonably well-sampled. It is otherwise not particularly accurate. The extrapolators are largely insensitive to the influence of abundance distribution evenness, as quantified using Pielou's J and a new index called the ratio of means. Quorum subsampling generally performs well, but it stumbles on the split-analyze-and-sum test and is confounded somewhat by evenness.},

	abstract = {The diversity of life on Earth is controlled by hierarchical processes that interact over wide ranges of timescales1. Here, we consider the megaclimate regime2 at scales ≥1 million years (Myr). We focus on determining the domains of `wandering' stochastic Earth system processes (`Court Jester'3) and stabilizing biotic interactions that induce diversity dependence of fluctuations in macroevolutionary rates (`Red Queen'4). Using state-of-the-art multiscale Haar and cross-Haar fluctuation analyses, we analysed the global genus-level Phanerozoic marine animal Paleobiology Database record of extinction rates (E), origination rates (O) and diversity (D) as well as sea water palaeotemperatures (T). Over the entire observed range from several million years to several hundred million years, we found that the fluctuations of T, E and O showed time-scaling behaviour. The megaclimate was characterized by positive scaling exponents---it is therefore apparently unstable. E and O are also scaling but with negative exponents---stable behaviour that is biotically mediated. For D, there were two regimes with a crossover at critical timescale \$\${\textbackslash}Delta \{t\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{trans\}\}\}\$\$ ≈ 40 Myr. For shorter timescales, D exhibited nearly the same positive scaling as the megaclimate palaeotemperatures, whereas for longer timescales it tracks the scaling of macroevolutionary rates. At scales of at least \$\${\textbackslash}Delta \{t\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{trans\}\}\}\$\$there is onset of diversity dependence of E and O, probably enabled by mixing and synchronization (globalization) of the biota by geodispersal (`Geo-Red Queen').},

Applications include identifying ancient mass extinctions and inferring both biotic and abiotic controls on diversification rates. We introduce divDyn, a new r package that facilitates the calculation of taxonomic richness, extinction and origination rates from time-binned fossil data. State-of-the-art counting protocols, and sampling standardization functions permit the reconstruction of biologically meaningful time series. Additional functions permit the partitioning of turnover rates by environmental affinity. Using divDyn, we display Phanerozoic-scale diversity dynamics of marine invertebrates. With the help of the core function and standard subsampling options, we revisit the hypothesis of declining taxonomic rates over time, mass extinctions and equilibrial diversity dynamics and assess their methodological dependency. Our results suggest that rates declined only over the early Phanerozoic, only three mass extinctions stand out clearly, and evidence of equilibrial dynamics is dependent on the used methods. The modular and fast implementation of published methods ensures traceability, reproducibility and comparability of future studies.},

@article{chaudhuri_modeling_2023,
	abstract = {Natural hazards like floods, cyclones, earthquakes, or, tsunamis have deep impacts on the environment and society causing damage to both life and property. These events can cause widespread destruction and can lead to long-term socio-economic disruption often affecting the most vulnerable populations in society. Computational modeling provides an essential tool to estimate the damage by incorporating spatial uncertainties and examining global risk assessments. Classical stationary models in spatial statistics often assume isotropy and stationarity. It causes inappropriate smoothing over features having boundaries, holes, or physical barriers. Despite this, nonstationary models like barrier model have been little explored in the context of natural disasters in complex land structures. The principal objective of the current study is to evaluate the influence of barrier models compared to classical stationary models by analysing the incidence of natural disasters in complex spatial regions like islands and coastal areas. In the current study, we have used tsunami records from the island nation of Maldives. For seven atoll groups considered in our study, we have implemented three distinct categories of stochastic partial differential equation meshes, two for stationary models and one that corresponds to the barrier model concept. The results show that when assessing the spatial variance of tsunami incidence at the atoll scale, the barrier model outperforms the other two models while maintaining the same computational cost as the stationary models. In the broader picture, this research work contributes to the relatively new field of nonstationary barrier models and intends to establish a robust modeling framework to explore spatial phenomena, particularly natural hazards, in complex spatial regions having physical barriers.},

To determine the abundance and distribution of such exotic salmon populations in the wild and their effect on native organisms, we conducted experimental fishing, in six locations in the salmon farming regions (41$\,^{\circ}$--46$\,^{\circ}$ S) in the inner seas of Chilo{\'e} (X Region) and Aysen (XI Region), between November 1995 and December 1996. At the same time, we collected information from salmon farms and insurance companies about escaped individuals. During the experimental fishing we captured 2602 coho salmon, 984 trout, and 271 Atlantic salmon. Captures of the three species declined through the duration of the study; thus in November 1996 we captured {\textless}10\% of initial catches. Population projections based on three possible mortality rates (0.4, 0.8, and 1.2) predicted the disappearance of salmon by year 2000, and the highest mortality rate was the best predictor of the observed available biomass in 1996. Thus, artisanal fishing may control escaped salmon. Of the three species, coho salmon had the best chances of becoming established in the remote XI Region where the artisanal fishing pressure was less intense. The three salmon species showed feeding similarities, since each kept feeding on pellets beneath the farms, particularly Atlantic salmon, while coho salmon showed greater preference for schooling fish, and rainbow trout fed more often on crustaceans. Thus, the three species, particularly coho salmon, could compete with native southern hake and mackerel. As a management approach to avoid salmon colonization and naturalization in southern Chile, local artisanal fishing should be encouraged because it is probably the most efficient way to remove escaped individuals and reduce the chance of populations becoming self-sustaining.},

@article{carranza_socio-environmental_2020,
	abstract = {Biodiversity is vital in the functioning of ecosystems, but it's permanently being threatened by anthropic impacts derived from productive activities. Thus, conservation has become a global challenge. In Chile, the dissociation between economic activities and conservation has triggered numerous socio-environmental conflicts in recent decades. This work explores how different projects that give rise to these conflicts can represent an underestimated threat to biodiversity. We identified socio-environmental conflicts in Chile and their associated projects by carrying out an online review of 1035 news articles published between 2004 and 2018 using the key words ``environmental conflict''. We selected articles describing a socio-environmental conflict between parties caused by a project or productive sector. Conflict-generating projects were classified by productive sector and capital origin. In addition, their geographical distribution with respect to High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs, protected areas and priority sites for conservation) was determined. A total of 283 projects were identified from 14 different productive sectors, most of them related to energy and mining, which threaten biodiversity and human well-being mainly due to pollution and habitat destruction. Chilean companies finance most of the projects, but international companies finance over half of the energy and mining projects. Moreover, 37 \% of the projects were located within HCVAs either for the establishment of future protected areas or where protected areas are currently established. As countries make new efforts to maintain and recover biodiversity, it is contradictory not to consider the threats posed by conflict-generating projects to key areas for conservation, both in public policies and in spatial planning instruments.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic threats and their impacts on aquatic ecosystems have traditionally been evaluated only through literature reviews. Within the last decade, however, expert opinions have become an increasingly popular alternative for gaining complementary information to literature reviews. This study employed a standardized method for collecting bibliographic data combined with synthesize expert opinions to establish a current knowledge baseline on threats to Mediterranean freshwater ecosystems in Chile. We revised 79 scientific articles that included a variety of taxonomic groups containing fish (n = 32); macroinvertebrates (n = 17); amphibians (n = 18); freshwater plants (n = 8); and two taxonomic groups simultaneously (n = 4). From this review, we identified 14 threats, with land-use change, species introductions, and industrial/domestic effluents as salient factors. These findings were in agreement with results from expert opinion surveys (n = 46 researchers). An analysis by taxonomic group indicated freshwater fishes as most threatened by hydropower plants. Aquatic plants were most threatened by mining. Amphibians were most threatened by changes in soil use whereas aquatic macroinvertebrates by industrial/domestic effluents. Remarkably, the magnitude of threats identified in the literature review was of similar order than those catalogued by experts. Moreover, the primary threats identified here align with those reported in other Mediterranean regions of the world. Our combined approach using literature review and expert opinion was useful in determining the consistency of the main threats to each taxonomic group. Our findings can be used as a baseline to further research and in prioritizing management strategies for threatened Mediterranean ecosystems worldwide.},

@article{vuong_emerging_2017,
	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that affects one in 45 children in the United States, with a similarly striking prevalence in countries around the world. However, mechanisms underlying its etiology and manifestations remain poorly understood. Although ASD is diagnosed based on the presence and severity of impaired social communication and repetitive behavior, immune dysregulation and gastrointestinal issues are common comorbidities. The microbiome is an integral part of human physiology; recent studies show that changes in the gut microbiota can modulate gastrointestinal physiology, immune function, and even behavior. Links between particular bacteria from the indigenous gut microbiota and phenotypes relevant to ASD raise the important question of whether microbial dysbiosis plays a role in the development or presentation of ASD symptoms. Here we review reports of microbial dysbiosis in ASD. We further discuss potential effects of the microbiota on ASD-associated symptoms, drawing on signaling mechanisms for reciprocal interactions among the microbiota, immunity, gut function, and behavior. In addition, we discuss recent findings supporting a role for the microbiome as an interface between environmental and genetic risk factors that are associated with ASD. These studies highlight the integration of pathways across multiple body systems that together can impact brain and behavior and suggest that changes in the microbiome may contribute to symptoms of neurodevelopmental disease.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severely neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs a child's ability to communicate and interact with others. Children with neurodevelopmental disorder, including ASD, are regularly affected by gastrointestinal problems and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. On the other hand, humans live in a co-evolutionary association with plenty of microorganisms that resident on the exposed and internal surfaces of our bodies. The microbiome, refers to the collection of microbes and their genetic material, confers a variety of physiologic benefits to the host in many key aspects of life as well as being responsible for some diseases. A large body of preclinical literature indicates that gut microbiome plays an important role in the bidirectional gut-brain axis that communicates between the gut and central nervous system. Moreover, accumulating evidences suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the pathogenesis of ASD. The present review introduces the increasing evidence suggesting the reciprocal interaction network among microbiome, gut and brain. It also discusses the possible mechanisms by which gut microbiome influences the etiology of ASD via altering gut-brain axis. Most importantly, it highlights the new findings of targeting gut microbiome, including probiotic treatment and fecal microbiota transplant, as novel and potential therapeutics for ASD diseases.},

@article{jeanmougin_should_2010,
	abstract = {High-throughput post-genomic studies are now routinely and promisingly investigated in biological and biomedical research. The main statistical approach to select genes differentially expressed between two groups is to apply a t-test, which is subject of criticism in the literature. Numerous alternatives have been developed based on different and innovative variance modeling strategies. However, a critical issue is that selecting a different test usually leads to a different gene list. In this context and given the current tendency to apply the t-test, identifying the most efficient approach in practice remains crucial. To provide elements to answer, we conduct a comparison of eight tests representative of variance modeling strategies in gene expression data: Welch's t-test, ANOVA [1], Wilcoxon's test, SAM [2], RVM [3], limma [4], VarMixt [5] and SMVar [6]. Our comparison process relies on four steps (gene list analysis, simulations, spike-in data and re-sampling) to formulate comprehensive and robust conclusions about test performance, in terms of statistical power, false-positive rate, execution time and ease of use. Our results raise concerns about the ability of some methods to control the expected number of false positives at a desirable level. Besides, two tests (limma and VarMixt) show significant improvement compared to the t-test, in particular to deal with small sample sizes. In addition limma presents several practical advantages, so we advocate its application to analyze gene expression data.},

@article{mcmurdie_phyloseq_2013,
	abstract = {Background The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. Conclusions The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

@article{williams_regulation_2020,
	abstract = {The microbiome regulates endocrine systems and influences many aspects of hormone signaling. Using examples from different animal taxa, we highlight the state of the science in microbiome research as it relates to endocrinology and endocrine disruption research. Using a comparative approach discussing fish, birds, and mammals, we demonstrate the bidirectional interaction between microbiota and hormone systems, presenting concepts that include (1) gastrointestinal microbiome regulation of the neuroendocrine feeding axis; (2) stress hormones and microbial communities; (3) the role of site-specific microbiota in animal reproduction; (4) microbiome effects on the neuroendocrine systems and behavior; and (5) novel mechanisms of endocrine disruption through the microbiome. This mini-review demonstrates that hormones can directly affect the richness and diversity of microbiota and conversely, microbiota can influence hormone production and mediate their functions in animals. In addition, microbiota can influence the action of a diverse range of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the central nervous system, which can lead to behavioral disruptions. As many animals have species-specific reproductive behaviors, it is important to understand how shifts in the microbiota relate to these complex interactions between sexes. This is especially important for captive animals on specialized diets, and there are significant implications for microbiome research in conservation and reproductive biology. For example, microbial metabolites may modify motility of gametes or modulate hormone-receptor interactions in reproductive tissues. Thus, efforts to incorporate metabolomics into the science of microbiome-endocrine relationships, both those produced by the host and those generated from microbial metabolism, are increasingly needed. These concepts have fostered an exciting emerging era in comparative endocrinology.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in the potential contribution of the gut microbiome to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous studies have been underpowered and have not been designed to address potential confounding factors in a comprehensive way. We performed a large autism stool metagenomics study (n = 247) based on participants from the Australian Autism Biobank and the Queensland Twin Adolescent Brain project. We found negligible direct associations between ASD diagnosis and the gut microbiome. Instead, our data support a model whereby ASD-related restricted interests are associated with less-diverse diet, and in turn reduced microbial taxonomic diversity and looser stool consistency. In contrast to ASD diagnosis, our dataset was well powered to detect microbiome associations with traits such as age, dietary intake, and stool consistency. Overall, microbiome differences in ASD may reflect dietary preferences that relate to diagnostic features, and we caution against claims that the microbiome has a driving role in ASD.},

@article{cao_effects_2021,
	abstract = {Background: The accuracy of microbial community detection in 16S rRNA marker-gene and metagenomic studies suffers from contamination and sequencing errors that lead to either falsely identifying microbial taxa that were not in the sample or misclassifying the taxa of DNA fragment reads. Removing contaminants and filtering rare features are two common approaches to deal with this problem. While contaminant detection methods use auxiliary sequencing process information to identify known contaminants, filtering methods remove taxa that are present in a small number of samples and have small counts in the samples where they are observed. The latter approach reduces the extreme sparsity of microbiome data and has been shown to correctly remove contaminant taxa in cultured ``mock'' datasets, where the true taxa compositions are known. Although filtering is frequently used, careful evaluation of its effect on the data analysis and scientific conclusions remains unreported. Here, we assess the effect of filtering on the alpha and beta diversity estimation as well as its impact on identifying taxa that discriminate between disease states.Results: The effect of filtering on microbiome data analysis is illustrated on four datasets: two mock quality control datasets where the same cultured samples with known microbial composition are processed at different labs and two disease study datasets. Results show that in microbiome quality control datasets, filtering reduces the magnitude of differences in alpha diversity and alleviates technical variability between labs while preserving the between samples similarity (beta diversity). In the disease study datasets, DESeq2 and linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) methods were used to identify taxa that are differentially abundant across groups of samples, and random forest models were used to rank features with the largest contribution toward disease classification. Results reveal that filtering retains significant taxa and preserves the model classification ability measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The comparison between the filtering and the contaminant removal method shows that they have complementary effects and are advised to be used in conjunction.Conclusions: Filtering reduces the complexity of microbiome data while preserving their integrity in downstream analysis. This leads to mitigation of the classification methods' sensitivity and reduction of technical variability, allowing researchers to generate more reproducible and comparable results in microbiome data analysis.},

@article{hao_clustering_2011,
	abstract = {Motivation: With the advancements of next-generation sequencing technology, it is now possible to study samples directly obtained from the environment. Particularly, 16S rRNA gene sequences have been frequently used to profile the diversity of organisms in a sample. However, such studies are still taxed to determine both the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and their relative abundance in a sample.Results: To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised Bayesian clustering method termed Clustering 16S rRNA for OTU Prediction (CROP). CROP can find clusters based on the natural organization of data without setting a hard cut-off threshold (3\%/5\%) as required by hierarchical clustering methods. By applying our method to several datasets, we demonstrate that CROP is robust against sequencing errors and that it produces more accurate results than conventional hierarchical clustering methods.Availability and Implementation: Source code freely available at the following URL: http://code.google.com/p/crop-tingchenlab/, implemented in C++ and supported on Linux and MS Windows.Contact:tingchen@usc.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{chen_comparison_2013,
	abstract = {Recent studies of 16S rRNA sequences through next-generation sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the microbial community composition and structure. One common approach in using these data to explore the genetic diversity in a microbial community is to cluster the 16S rRNA sequences into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on sequence similarities. The inferred OTUs can then be used to estimate species, diversity, composition, and richness. Although a number of methods have been developed and commonly used to cluster the sequences into OTUs, relatively little guidance is available on their relative performance and the choice of key parameters for each method. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ten existing OTU inference methods. We found that the appropriate dissimilarity value for defining distinct OTUs is not only related with a specific method but also related with the sample complexity. For data sets with low complexity, all the algorithms need a higher dissimilarity threshold to define OTUs. Some methods, such as, CROP and SLP, are more robust to the specific choice of the threshold than other methods, especially for shorter reads. For high-complexity data sets, hierarchical cluster methods need a more strict dissimilarity threshold to define OTUs because the commonly used dissimilarity threshold of 3\% often leads to an under-estimation of the number of OTUs. In general, hierarchical clustering methods perform better at lower dissimilarity thresholds. Our results show that sequence abundance plays an important role in OTU inference. We conclude that care is needed to choose both a threshold for dissimilarity and abundance for OTU inference.},

The emerging field of metagenomics offers a new way of exploring the microbial world that will transform modern microbiology and lead to practical applications in medicine, agriculture, alternative energy, environmental remediation, and many others areas. Metagenomics allows researchers to look at the genomes of all of the microbes in an environment at once, providing a "meta" view of the whole microbial community and the complex interactions within it. It's a quantum leap beyond traditional research techniques that rely on studying-one at a time-the few microbes that can be grown in the laboratory. At the request of the National Science Foundation, five Institutes of the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy, the National Research Council organized a committee to address the current state of metagenomics and identify obstacles current researchers are facing in order to determine how to best support the field and encourage its success. The New Science of Metagenomics recommends the establishment of a "Global Metagenomics Initiative" comprising a small number of large-scale metagenomics projects as well as many medium- and small-scale projects to advance the technology and develop the standard practices needed to advance the field. The report also addresses database needs, methodological challenges, and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in supporting this new field.},

	abstract = {We explore the microbiota of 18 body sites in over 200 individuals using sequences amplified V1--V3 and the V3--V5 small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S) hypervariable regions as part of the NIH Common Fund Human Microbiome Project. The body sites with the greatest number of core OTUs, defined as OTUs shared amongst 95\% or more of the individuals, were the oral sites (saliva, tongue, cheek, gums, and throat) followed by the nose, stool, and skin, while the vaginal sites had the fewest number of OTUs shared across subjects. We found that commonalities between samples based on taxonomy could sometimes belie variability at the sub-genus OTU level. This was particularly apparent in the mouth where a given genus can be present in many different oral sites, but the sub-genus OTUs show very distinct site selection, and in the vaginal sites, which are consistently dominated by the Lactobacillus genus but have distinctly different sub-genus V1--V3 OTU populations across subjects. Different body sites show approximately a ten-fold difference in estimated microbial richness, with stool samples having the highest estimated richness, followed by the mouth, throat and gums, then by the skin, nasal and vaginal sites. Richness as measured by the V1--V3 primers was consistently higher than richness measured by V3--V5. We also show that when such a large cohort is analyzed at the genus level, most subjects fit the stool ``enterotype'' profile, but other subjects are intermediate, blurring the distinction between the enterotypes. When analyzed at the finer-scale, OTU level, there was little or no segregation into stool enterotypes, but in the vagina distinct biotypes were apparent. Finally, we note that even OTUs present in nearly every subject, or that dominate in some samples, showed orders of magnitude variation in relative abundance emphasizing the highly variable nature across individuals.},

@article{johnson_evaluation_2019,
	abstract = {The 16S rRNA gene has been a mainstay of sequence-based bacterial analysis for decades. However, high-throughput sequencing of the full gene has only recently become a realistic prospect. Here, we use in silico and sequence-based experiments to critically re-evaluate the potential of the 16S gene to provide taxonomic resolution at species and strain level. We demonstrate that targeting of 16S variable regions with short-read sequencing platforms cannot achieve the taxonomic resolution afforded by sequencing the entire ({\textasciitilde}1500 bp) gene. We further demonstrate that full-length sequencing platforms are sufficiently accurate to resolve subtle nucleotide substitutions (but not insertions/deletions) that exist between intragenomic copies of the 16S gene. In consequence, we argue that modern analysis approaches must necessarily account for intragenomic variation between 16S gene copies. In particular, we demonstrate that appropriate treatment of full-length 16S intragenomic copy variants has the potential to provide taxonomic resolution of bacterial communities at species and strain level.},

@article{saeed_16s_2019,
	abstract = {Despite the availability of abundant literature on green tea, studies on the use of L-theanine (an amino acid found only in green tea) as a feed additive in poultry especially broiler are limited. So, this study was conducted to explore the effects of L-theanine on the intestinal microbiome and immune response in a broiler. A total of 400-d-old chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) using a complete randomized design. Treatments were as follows: A, control (basal diet); B, basal diet + 100 mg L-theanine/kg diet; C, basal diet + 200 mg L-theanine/kg diet; and D, basal diet + 300 mg L-theanine/kg diet. Mucosal samples from ileum and jejunum of broiler chicken were extracted at 21 and 42 d of age. Extraction of genomic DNA was followed by amplification of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA. After Illumina sequencing, results revealed that treatment with L-theanine significantly increased the population of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum as compared to a control group, but the higher population was observed in jejunum at both 21 and 42 d of age. The overall diversity of the jejunum microbiome in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the ileum and control group (P {\textless} 0.05). Results of this study revealed that mRNA expression of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) was decreased in response to treatment with L-theanine. Moreover, the negative correlation of abundance of Lactobacillus was observed with expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the intestine and these effects were highly significant (P {\textless} 0.01). In summary, our finding revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine exhibited a positive influence on intestinal bacteria by supporting beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus while decreasing harmful microbes like Clostridium.},

	abstract = {The fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) (APA in diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, Author, Washington, 2013) has decided to merge the subtypes of pervasive developmental disorders into a single category of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the assumption that they cannot be reliably differentiated from one another. The purpose of this review is to analyze the basis of this assumption by examining the comparative studies between Asperger's disorder (AsD) and autistic disorder (AD), and between pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS) and AD. In all, 125 studies compared AsD with AD. Of these, 30 studies concluded that AsD and AD were similar conditions while 95 studies found quantitative and qualitative differences between them. Likewise, 37 studies compared PDDNOS with AD. Nine of these concluded that PDDNOS did not differ significantly from AD while 28 reported quantitative and qualitative differences between them. Taken together, these findings do not support the conceptualization of AD, AsD and PDDNOS as a single category of ASD. Irrespective of the changes proposed by the DSM-5, future research and clinical practice will continue to find ways to meaningfully subtype the ASD.},

@article{mcmurdie_waste_2014,
	abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

	abstract = {Human milk sodium ([Na]) and potassium ([K]) concentrations were measured every 4 h for 24 h in 28 subjects 3.5 to 32 wk postpartum. A diurnal variation in milk Na was seen, which was reciprocal to K. Significant negative correlations between Na and K were seen in these periods: 3.5 to 6; 8 to 18, 20 to 32 wk postpartum (p \&lt; 0.01 for each). The mean 24 h milk sodium concentrations (x̄Na) decreased between 3.5 and 18 wk postpartum (p \&lt; 0.005 by paired t test). Changes in mean potassium (x̄K) were not statistically significant. Diet apparently does not affect milk Na. Administration of a low Na diet: 10.8 $\pm$ .9 (SD) mEq Na/day and 60 to 100 mEq K/day for 2 days did not change x̄Na. But urinary Na decreased 7-fold as aldosterone increased 5-fold. No significant correlation was seen between 24 h Na excretion in urine and x̄Na in milk (n = 51). A significant positive correlation was seen between urinary K and x̄K in milk (r = 0.36), p \&lt; 0.001).},

Estimated fluid intake during the race for HN was 12.5 +/- 1.6 (SE) liters over 9 h 41 min (+/- 28 min). HN excreted a net fluid excess of 2.95 +/- 0.56 (range 1.2--5.9) liters compared with a fluid deficit of 2.7 +/- 0.3\% body weight in NN. The sodium deficit was 153 +/- 35 mmol in HN and 187 +/- 37 mmol in NN. Despite the fluid overload, plasma volume was decreased by 24.1 +/- 5.0\% in HN compared with 8.2 +/- 2.6\% in NN. Serum renin activity (5.1 +/- 2.0 ng.ml-1.h-1), aldosterone concentrations (410 +/- 34 ng/l), creatinine clearances (174.8 +/- 28.2 ml/min), and urine output (6.4 +/- 1.0 ml/min) were markedly elevated in HN during recovery. Thus the hyponatremia of exercise results from fluid retention in subjects who ingest abnormally large fluid volumes during prolonged exercise.},

@incollection{pasantes-morales_taurine_2017,
	abstract = {Taurine content is high (mM) in mammalian brain. By its major role as an osmolyte, taurine contributes to the cell volume control, which is particularly critical in the brain. Taurine participates in osmotic adjustments required to maintain the organization and size of intracellular compartments. It counteracts volume fluctuations in unbalanced transmembrane fluxes of ions and neurotransmitters, preserving the functional synaptic contacts. Taurine has a key role in the long-term adaptation to chronic hyponatremia as well as in other pathologies leading to brain edema. Together with other osmolytes, taurine corrects cell shrinkage, preventing mysfunction of organelles and apoptosis. Swelling corrective taurine efflux occurs through a leak pathway, likely formed by LCRR8 protein isoforms. Shrinkage-activated influx comes largely by the increased activity of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporter. The brain taurine pool results from the equilibrium between (i) dietary intake and active transport into the cell, (ii) synthesis in the brain itself or import of that synthesized elsewhere, and (iii) leak and posterior excretion. The interplay between these elements preserves brain taurine homeostasis in physiological conditions and permits the proper adjustments upon deviations of normal in the internal/external environment.},

The frequency and outcomes of hyponatremia in congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, pneumonia, and human immunodeficiency virus infection also are reviewed. Although the knowledge on hyponatremia has expanded in the past few decades, the disorder largely remains an underdiagnosed condition. Substantial additional work is needed to improve the awareness of hyponatremia among medical professionals.

@article{goh_management_2004,
	abstract = {Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.},

@article{siegel_fatal_2015,
	abstract = {Cerebral edema due to exercise-associated hyponatremia and cardiac arrest due to atherosclerotic heart disease cause rare marathonrelated fatalities in young female and middle-aged male runners, respectively. Studies in asymptomatic middle-aged male runners during races identified inflammation due to skeletal muscle injury after glycogen depletion as the shared underlying cause. Nonosmotic secretion of arginine vasopressin as a neuroendocrine stress response to rhabdomyolysis mediates hyponatremia as a variant of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Fatal hyponatremic encephalopathy in young female runners was curtailed using emergent infusion of intravenous hypertonic (3\%) saline to reverse cerebral edema based on this paradigm, which treatment was arrived at through a consensus process within the medical community. An increasing frequency of cardiac arrest and sudden death has been identified in middle-aged male runners in two studies since the year 2000. Same-aged asymptomatic male physician-runners showed post-race elevations in interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, which biomarkers predict acute cardiac events in healthy persons. Hypercoagulability with in vivo platelet activation and release of cardiac troponin and NT-pro-B-natriuretic peptide were also observed post-race in these same subjects. High short-term risk for atherothrombosis during races as shown by stratification of biomarkers in asymptomatic males may render non-obstructive coronary atherosclerotic plaques vulnerable to rupture. Pre-race aspirin usage in this high-risk subgroup is prudent based on conclusive evidence for preventing first acute myocardial infarctions in same-aged healthy male physicians. Based on validated clinical paradigms, taking a low-dose aspirin before a marathon and drinking to thirst during the race may avert preventable deaths in susceptible runners.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

@article{mettler_hyponatremia_2008,
	abstract = {Objective: Hyperhydration and exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) are critical issues during endurance events. We studied a cohort of marathon runners to examine EAH's prevalence in a marathon with a short time limit and to investigate underlying mechanisms that may be responsible for its development. Design: Observational cohort study. Setting: 2006 Zurich Marathon (cool and rainy weather, time limit of 5 hours). Participants: 167 marathon runners were recruited the month before the race. Main Outcome Measures: Body mass, plasma sodium, and osmolality were measured just before the start and immediately after the race. Fluid intake during the race was ascertained by a recall questionnaire.
Results: Five subjects (3 \%) developed asymptomatic EAH, and no symptomatic EAH was found. Body mass change during the race correlated similarly with postrace sodium levels (r = 20.72, P , 0.0001) and with sodium change during the race (r = 20.66, P , 0.0001). Postrace sodium levels correlated significantly with sodium change during the race (r = 0.74, P , 0.0001). Fluid intake correlated significantly (r = 20.43, P , 0.0001) with plasma sodium change between the start and finish of the race. Postrace sodium levels and postrace osmolality were significantly correlated (r = 0.68, P , 0.0001).
Conclusion: In this study we observed a relatively low incidence of EAH in subjects running the marathon in around 2.5 to 5 hours and in a cool environment. Plasma sodium change during the race and postrace sodium levels correlated with body mass change. There was also a direct correlation between fluid intake and plasma sodium change during the race.},

Practical missing data analysis issues are discussed, most notably the inclusion of auxiliary variables for improving power and reducing bias. Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out. Suggestions are given for moving forward with research on missing data and attrition.},

In this setting, it is important to estimate the mean time to the survival endpoint using limited information (typically from randomized trials) and thus it is useful to consider parametric survival models. In this paper, we review the features of the R package survHE, specifically designed to wrap several tools to perform survival analysis for economic evaluation. In particular, survHE embeds both a standard, frequentist analysis (through the R package flexsurv) and a Bayesian approach, based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (via the R package rstan) or integrated nested Laplace approximation (with the R package INLA). Using this composite approach, we obtain maximum flexibility and are able to pre-compile a wide range of parametric models, with a view of simplifying the modelers' work and allowing them to move away from non-optimal work flows, including spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel).},

@article{ayus_hyponatremia_2000,
	abstract = {Background: Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is often associated with increased intracranial pressure and can be the initial manifestation of hyponatremic encephalopathy. Marathon runners tend to develop conditions that lead to hyponatremia. In a recent prospective study, 18\% of 605 marathon runners developed hyponatremia; women with hyponatremia had lower plasma sodium levels and were more symptomatic than men (1). Hyponatremia in these patients resulted from substantial retention of ingested water (1). We recently reported that patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy can present with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (2). In the present report, we describe seven marathon runners who presented with hyponatremic encephalopathy and pulmonary edema.
Objective: To describe the development and treatment of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in marathon runners that was associated with hyponatremic encephalopathy. Case Findings Design: Case series. Setting: One university hospital and two community hospitals. Patients: Seven healthy marathon runners who had a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. The runners collapsed after competing in a marathon and were hospitalized with pulmonary edema.
Measurements: Plasma sodium levels, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, cardiac enzyme levels, and magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans of the brain.
Results: Patients had nausea, emesis, and obtundation. The mean (ϮSD) plasma sodium level was 121 Ϯ 3 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation was less than 70\%. Electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were normal. Chest radiographs showed pulmonary edema with a normal heart. Creatine phosphokinase--MB bands, troponin levels, and pulmonary wedge pressure were not elevated. Scanning of the brain showed cerebral edema. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Treatment with intravenous NaCl, 514 mmol/L, increased plasma sodium levels by 10 mmol/L in 12 hours. Pulmonary and cerebral edema resolved as the sodium level increased. One patient had unsuspected hyponatremic encephalopathy and died of cardiopulmonary arrest caused by brainstem herniation. All six treated patients recovered and were well after 1 year of follow-up.
Conclusions: In healthy marathon runners, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema can be associated with hyponatremic encephalopathy. The condition may be fatal if undiagnosed and can be successfully treated with hypertonic NaCl.},

This review emphasizes the value of identifying current nutritional approaches specific to individuals with ASD and integrating their effects on symptoms to the conversation and presents suggestions for future research designed to identify medical nutrition therapies targeting this population to better understand the link between ASD and nutrition.},

Several chemical exposures such as air pollution (e.g., particular matter 2.5), pesticides, bisphenol A, phthalates, mercury, and nutrition deficiency such as folic acid, vitamin D, or fatty acid may possibly be associated with an increased risk of ASD, whereas other traditional risk factors such as smoking/tobacco, alcohol, or polychlorinated biphenyls are less likely to be associated with ASD. Further research is needed to accumulate evidence on the association between chemical exposure and nutrient deficiencies and ASD in various doses and populations.},

@article{sande_autism_2014,
	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by deficits in the ability to socialise, communicate and use imagination, and displays of stereotypical behaviour. It is widely accepted that ASD involves a disorder in brain development. However, the real causes of the neurodevelopmental disorders associated with ASD are not clear. In this respect, it has been found that a majority of children with ASD display gastrointestinal symptoms, and an increased intestinal permeability. Moreover, large differences in microbiotic composition between ASD patients and controls have been reported. Therefore, nutrition-related factors have been hypothesised to play a causal role in the aetiology of ASD and its symptoms. Through a review of the literature, it was found that abnormalities in carbohydrate digestion and absorption could explain some of the gastrointestinal problems observed in a subset of ASD patients, although their role in the neurological and behavioural problems remains uncertain. In addition, the relationship between an improved gut health and a reduction of symptoms in some patients was evaluated. Recent trials involving gluten-free diets, casein-free diets, and pre- and probiotic, and multivitamin supplementation show contradictive but promising results. It can be concluded that nutrition and other environmental influences might trigger an unstable base of genetic predisposition, which may lead to the development of autism, at least in a subset of ASD patients. Clear directions for further research to improve diagnosis and treatment for the different subsets of the disorder are provided.},

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. To enhance the understanding of the gut microbiota structure in ASD children at different ages as well as the relationship between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, we first used the 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate the gut microbial population in a cohort of 143 children aged 2--13 years old. We found that the α-diversity of ASD group showed no significant change with age, while the TD group showed increased α-diversity with age, which indicates that the compositional development of the gut microbiota in ASD varies at different ages in ways that are not consistent with TD group. Recent studies have shown that chronic constipation is one of the most commonly obvious gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms along with ASD core symptoms. To further investigate the potential interaction effects between ASD and GI symptoms, the 30 C-ASD and their aged-matched TD were picked out to perform metagenomics analysis. We observed that C-ASD group displayed decreased diversity, depletion of species of Sutterella, Prevotella, and Bacteroides as well as dysregulation of associated metabolism activities, which may involve in the pathogenesis of C-ASD. Consistent with metagenomic analysis, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) revealed some of the differential metabolites between C-ASD and TD group were involved in the metabolic network of neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, histidine, and GABA. Furthermore, we found these differences in metabolites were associated with altered abundance of specific bacteria. The study suggested possible future modalities for ASD intervention through targeting the specific bacteria associated with neurotransmitter metabolism.},

For marine conservation, global marine protected area (MPA) coverage is still falling short of the 10\% target set in 2010. Here we show that while this reflects a lack of progress in many low- and middle-income countries, a few of these nations have met or exceeded international commitments. To provide an in-depth explanation of how this was achieved in Gabon, we summarize the lessons learnt by our consortium of policy makers and practitioners who helped implement a comprehensive and ecologically representative network of 20 MPAs. We show the importance of creating a national framework, building long-term stakeholder support, and focusing on research that guides implementation and policy; and outline a four-step approach that countries and donors could use as an example to help meet international commitments. By responding to calls to share lessons learned to inform future Convention on Biological Diversity targets, we show how Gabon's experiences could inform change elsewhere.},

	abstract = {The utilization of marine renewable energies such as offshore wind farming leads to globally expanding human activities in marine habitats. While knowledge on the responses to offshore wind farms and associated shipping traffic is accumulating now at a fast pace, it becomes important to assess the population impacts on species affected by those activities. In the North Sea, the protected diver species Red-throated Diver (
              Gavia stellata
              ) and Black-throated Diver (
              Gavia arctica
              ) widely avoid offshore wind farms. We used an explicit spatio-temporal Bayesian model to get a robust estimate of the diver population during the spring season between 2001 and 2018, based on a set of aerial surveys from long-term monitoring programs within the German North Sea. Despite the erection of 20 offshore wind farms in the study area and marked responses of divers to wind farms, model results indicated that there was no population decline, and overall numbers fluctuated around 16,600 individuals, with average annual 95\% CI ranging between 13,400 and 21,360 individuals. Although, avoidance behavior due to wind farm development led to a more narrowly focused spatial distribution of the birds centered in the persistent high concentration zone in the Eastern German Bight Special Protection Area, the results provide no indication of negative fitness consequences on these long-lived species. However, more research is needed on habitat use and food availability in this regard.},

@article{munoz_estimation_2013,
	abstract = {A methodological approach for modelling the occurrence patterns of species for the purpose of fisheries management is proposed here. The presence/absence of the species is modelled with a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model using the geographical and environmental characteristics of each fishing location. Maps of predicted probabilities of presence are generated using Bayesian kriging. Bayesian inference on the parameters and prediction of presence/absence in new locations (Bayesian kriging) are made by considering the model as a latent Gaussian model, which allows the use of the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) software (which has been seen to be quite a bit faster than the well-known MCMC methods). In particular, the spatial effect has been implemented with the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach. The methodology is evaluated on Mediterranean horse mackerel (Trachurus mediterraneus) in the Western Mediterranean. The analysis shows that environmental and geographical factors can play an important role in directing local distribution and variability in the occurrence of species. Although this approach is used to recognize the habitat of mackerel, it could also be for other different species and life stages in order to improve knowledge of fish populations and communities.},

	abstract = {Basic information on the distribution and habitat preferences of ecologically important species is essential for their management and protection. In the Mediterranean Sea there is increasing concern over elasmobranch species because their biological (ecological) characteristics make them highly vulnerable to fishing pressure. Their removal could affect the structure and function of marine ecosystems, inducing changes in trophic interactions at the community level due to the selective elimination of predators or prey species, competitors and species replacement. In this study Bayesian hierarchical spatial models are used to map the sensitive habitats of the three most caught elasmobranch species (Galeus melastomus, Scyliorhinus canicula, Etmopterus spinax) in the western Mediterranean Sea, based on fishery-dependent bottom trawl data. Results show that habitats associated with hard substrata and sandy beds, mainly in deep waters and with a high seabed gradient, have a greater probability registering the presence of the studied species than those associated with muddy shallow waters. Temperature and chlorophyll-α concentration show a negative relationship with S. canicula occurrence. Our results identify some of the sensitive habitats for elasmobranchs in the western Mediterranean Sea (GSA06 South), providing essential and easy-to-use interpretation tools, such as predictive distribution maps, with the final aim of improving management and conservation of these vulnerable species.},

Several studies have compared the performance of some of these techniques, offering relevant information on their use. These studies, however, have been mainly focused on terrestrial species, while marine ones have been less studied and fishery-dependent data from commercial fleet have been scarcely used. Here, we evaluate three different techniques of SDMs, such as hierarchical Bayesian spatial models, classification trees globally optimized with evolutionary algorithms and random forests, dealing with fishery-dependent data of two elasmobranch species. Most of the elasmobranchs are vulnerable species, more likely to be affected by intense fishing activity than most teleosts and for these reasons are considered a priority in fishery research and management. We discuss difference in the implemented approaches and the possible implication for the fishery management.},

	abstract = {The current European Union has been progressively implementing since January 2014 a discard ban which includes the obligation to land unwanted catch for certain regulated species and sizes. Although a full enforcement of the landing obligation has a direct impact on discard reduction through more responsible and selective fishing, fishers argue that it will prompt both a decrease in incomes and an increase in working time onboard. Thus, the measure is in a hold in south-western waters due to the difficulties to implement the ban in mixed fisheries This paper analyzes some possible scenarios which fishers could face under the landing obli- gation. It is shown the construction of a spatial bio-economic model to infer average costs, incomes and gross profits by fishing ground. We illustrate its use using a coastal trawling fleet based in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula as case study. Results show how fishing ground selection will remain the key factor affecting gross profits, well above the selection of closer fishing grounds, the improvement of fuel efficiency, or extending the length of the fishing trip. Increasing the number of crew members to overcome the expected excess of work time onboard would also be a cost-benefit balanced measure. According to our scenario simulations, to maintain business-as-usual (status quo situation) is the most probable fishing strategy without any regulation change. Fishing strategies are tight and maximized to current economic outcomes. Fishers will be reluctant to change their own fishing unless they are forced to for economic and/or regulatory reasons.},

In this paper we propose a new regionalization method for spatial functional data by means of a Dynamic Clustering Algorithm. The method optimizes a criterion of spatial association among functional data, it is such that the prototype is a trace-semivariogram model chosen from a set of mathematical functions that describes spatial relationships. The appropriate model is chosen by matching the shape of the curve of the experimental variogram to the shape of the curve of the mathematical function. Performances of these methods are checked through an application on real data.},

@article{verdoy_title_nodate,
	abstract = {Wildfires play an important role in shaping landscapes and as a source of CO2 and particulate matter, and are a typical spatial point process studied in many papers. Modeling the spatial variability of a wildfire could be performed in different ways and an important issue is the computational facilities that the new techniques afford us. The most common approaches have been through point pattern analysis or by Markov random fields. These methods have made it possible to build risk maps, but for many forest managers it is very useful to know the size of the fire as well as its location. In this work, we use Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) with Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to model the size of the forest fires observed in the Valencian Community, Spain. But the most important element in this paper is the process that needs to be carried out prior to simulating and analyzing the different point patterns, namely, the choice of the most suitable mesh for the database. We describe and take advantage of the Bayesian methodology by including INLA and SPDE in the modeling process in all the scenarios.},

@article{simpson_going_2016,
	abstract = {This paper introduces a new method for performing computational inference on log-Gaussian Cox processes. The likelihood is approximated directly by making use of a continuously specified Gaussian random field. We show that for sufficiently smooth Gaussian random field prior distributions, the approximation can converge with arbitrarily high order, whereas an approximation based on a counting process on a partition of the domain achieves only first-order convergence. The results improve upon the general theory of convergence for stochastic partial differential equation models introduced by Lindgren et al. (2011). The new method is demonstrated on a standard point pattern dataset, and two interesting extensions to the classical log-Gaussian Cox process framework are discussed. The first extension considers variable sampling effort throughout the observation window and implements the method of Chakraborty et al. (2011). The second extension constructs a log-Gaussian Cox process on the world's oceans. The analysis is performed using integrated nested Laplace approximation for fast approximate inference.},

@article{lindgren_explicit_2011,
	abstract = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in ℝ2 only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat{\'e}rn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of ℝd, between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

	abstract = {Improving traffic safety is a priority of most transportation agencies around the world. As part of traffic safety management strategies, efforts have focused on developing more accurate crash-frequency models and on identifying contributing factors in order to implement better countermeasures to improve traffic safety. Over time, models have increased in complexity and computational time. Bayesian models using the MCMC method have been commonly used in traffic safety analyses because of their ability to deal with complex models. Recently, the INLA approach has appeared as an alternative to the MCMC method by significantly reducing the computing time. In this study, an INLA-CAR model is developed to assess crashes by severity at the segment level on a highway section in Banda Aceh, Indonesia and is compared with a Bayesian non-spatial model. Results of the DIC show the importance of including spatial correlation in the models. The coefficient estimates show that AADT is the most influential in both models and across all severity types; however, the coefficient estimates for land use and horizontal alignment vary across severity types. Finally, in order to assess some limitations of the DIC, three other goodness-of-fit measures are used to cross-validate the results of the DIC.},

	abstract = {Priors are important for achieving proper posteriors with physically meaningful covariance structures for Gaussian random fields (GRFs) since the likelihood typically only provides limited information about the covariance structure under in-fill asymptotics. We extend the recent penalized complexity prior framework and develop a principled joint prior for the range and the marginal variance of one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional Mat{\'e}rn GRFs with fixed smoothness. The prior is weakly informative and penalizes complexity by shrinking the range toward infinity and the marginal variance toward zero. We propose guidelines for selecting the hyperparameters, and a simulation study shows that the new prior provides a principled alternative to reference priors that can leverage prior knowledge to achieve shorter credible intervals while maintaining good coverage. We extend the prior to a nonstationary GRF parameterized through local ranges and marginal standard deviations, and introduce a scheme for selecting the hyperparameters based on the coverage of the parameters when fitting simulated stationary data. The approach is applied to a dataset of annual precipitation in southern Norway and the scheme for selecting the hyperparameters leads to conservative estimates of nonstationarity and improved predictive performance over the stationary model.

@article{hooper_effects_2005,
	abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

@article{heithaus_predicting_2008,
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recent studies document unprecedented declines in marine top predators that can initiate trophic cascades. Predicting the wider ecological consequences of these declines requires understanding how predators influence communities by inflicting mortality on prey and inducing behavioral modifications (risk effects). Both mechanisms are important in marine communities, and a sole focus on the effects of predator-inflicted mortality might severely underestimate the importance of predators. We outline direct and indirect consequences of marine predator declines and propose an integrated predictive framework that includes risk effects, which appear to be strongest for long-lived prey species and when resources are abundant. We conclude that marine predators should be managed for the maintenance of both density- and risk-driven ecological processes, and not demographic persistence alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This is inadequate because these realms often interact through processes that form, utilize and maintain interfaces or connections, which are essential for the persistence of some species and ecosystem functions. We present a conceptual framework for systematic conservation prioritization that explicitly accounts for the connectivity between the terrestrial, marine, and freshwater realms. We propose a classification of this connectivity that encompasses: (1) narrow interfaces, such as riparian strips; (2) broad interfaces, such as estuaries; (3) constrained connections, such as corridors of native vegetation used by amphibians to move between natal ponds and adult habitat; and (4) diffuse connections, such as the movements of animals between breeding and feeding habitats. We use this taxonomy of inter-realm connectivity to describe existing and new spatial conservation prioritization techniques that aim to promote the persistence of processes that operate between realms.},

Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues.

	abstract = {The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

We describe here the R package inlabru that builds on the widely used RINLA package to provide easier access to Bayesian inference from spatial point process, spatial count, gridded, and georeferenced data, using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA, Rue et al., 2009). The package provides methods for fitting spatial density surfaces and estimating abundance, as well as for plotting and prediction. It accommodates data that are points, counts, georeferenced samples, or distance sampling data. This paper describes the main features of the package, illustrated by fitting models to the gorilla nest data contained in the package spatstat (Baddeley, \& Turner, 2005), a line transect survey dataset contained in the package dsm (Miller, Rexstad, Burt, Bravington, \& Hedley, 2018), and to a georeferenced sample from a simulated continuous spatial field.},

	abstract = {With over a million software users worldwide, and installations at over 5,000 universities, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI), established in 1969, is a world leader for the design and development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. GIS technology allows the organization, manipulation, analysis, and visualization of spatial data, often uncovering relationships, patterns, and trends. It is an important tool for urban planning (Maantay and Ziegler 2006), public health (Cromley and McLafferty 2002), law enforcement (Chainey and Ratcliffe 2005), ecology (Johnston 1998), transportation (Thill 2000), demographics (Peters and MacDonald 2004), resource management (Pettit et al. 2008), and many other industries (see http://www.esri.com/industries.html). Traditional GIS analysis techniques include spatial queries, map overlay, buffer analysis, interpolation, and proximity calculations (Mitchell 1999). Along with basic cartographic and data management tools, these analytical techniques have long been a foundation for geographic information software. Tools to perform spatial analysis have been extended over the years to include geostatistical techniques (Smith et al. 2006), raster analysis (Tomlin 1990), analytical methods for business (Pick 2008), 3D analysis (Abdul-Rahman et al. 2006), network analytics (Okabe et al. 2006), space-time dynamics (Peuquet 2002), and techniques specific to a variety of industries (e.g., Miller and Shaw 2001). In 2004, a new set of spatial statistics tools designed to describe feature patterns was added to ArcGIS 9. This chapter focuses on the methods and models found in the Spatial Statistics toolbox.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and degradation, overexploitation, climate change and the spread of invasive species are drastically depleting the Earth's biological diversity, leading to detrimental impacts on ecosystem services and human well-being. Our ability to monitor the state of biodiversity and the impacts of global environmental change on this natural capital is fundamental to designing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for preventing further loss of biological diversity. This requires the scientific community to assess spatio-temporal changes in the distribution of abiotic conditions (e.g. temperature, rainfall) and in the distribution, structure, composition and functioning of ecosystems. The potential for satellite remote sensing (SRS) to provide key data has been highlighted by many researchers, with SRS offering repeatable, standardized and verifiable information on long-term trends in biodiversity indicators. SRS permits one to address questions on scales inaccessible to ground-based methods alone, facilitating the development of an integrated approach to natural resource management, where biodiversity, pressures to biodiversity and consequences of management decisions can all be monitored. Synthesis and applications. Here, we provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the prospects of satellite remote sensing (SRS) for ecological applications, reviewing established avenues and highlighting new research and technological developments that have a high potential to make a difference in environmental management. We also discuss current barriers to the ecological application of SRS-based approaches and identify possible ways to overcome some of these limitations.},

In other words, spatial ecology is where geography and ecology intersect, and high-quality geospatial data and analysis tools are required to address emerging issues in spatial ecology. In this commentary and review for the International Journal of GIS Special Issue on Spatial Ecology, we highlight selected current research priorities in spatial ecology and describe geospatial data and methods for addressing these tasks. Geoinformation research themes are identified in population ecology, community and landscape ecology, and ecosystem ecology, and these themes are further linked to the assessment of ecosystem services. Methods in spatial ecology benefit from explicit consideration of spatial autocorrelation, and applications discussed in this review include species distribution modeling, remote sensing of community and ecosystem properties, and models of climate change. The linkages of the Special Issue papers to these emerging issues are described.},

@article{fotheringham_local_1999,

There is currently a rapid expansion in the development of such techniques but their history almost exactly parallels that of Geographical Analysis, with the first examples of local analysis appearing in the late 1960s. Indeed, Geographical Analysis has published many of the significant contributions in this field. This paper reviews the development of local forms of spatial analysis and assesses the current situation. Following a discussion on the nature and importance of local analysis, examples are given of local forms of point pattern analysis; local graphical approaches; local measures of spatial dependency; the spatial expansion method; adaptive filtering; multilevel modeling; geographically weighted regression; random coefficients models; autoregressive models; and local forms of spatial interaction models.},

@incollection{fortin_spatial_2006,
	abstract = {The first step in understanding ecological processes is to identify patterns. Ecological data are usually characterized by spatial structures due to spatial autocorrelation. Spatial autocorrelation refers to the pattern in which observations from nearby locations are more likely to have similar magnitude than by chance alone. The magnitude, intensity, as well as extent of spatial autocorrelation can be quantified using spatial statistics. Most ecological data exhibit some degree of spatial autocorrelation, depending on the scale at which the data were recorded and then analyzed. Ecological phenomena are also characterized by the multiple ecological processes that act upon them; these processes often operate at more than one spatial scale. Ecological data are a composite of several spatial scales: trends at macroscales; patches, gradients and patterns at meso- and local scales; and random patterns at local and microscales. The different processes and patterns at different scales are not necessarily linear or additive, and this contributes to the degree of spatial dependence in the data.},

@article{perry_illustrations_2002,
	abstract = {This paper aims to provide guidance to ecologists with limited experience in spatial analysis to help in their choice of techniques. It uses examples to compare methods of spatial analysis for ecological field data. A taxonomy of different data types is presented, including point- and area-referenced data, with and without attributes. Spatially and non-spatially explicit data are distinguished. The effects of sampling and other transformations that convert one data type to another are discussed; the possible loss of spatial information is considered. Techniques for analyzing spatial pattern, developed in plant ecology, animal ecology, landscape ecology, geostatistics and applied statistics are reviewed briefly and their overlap in methodology and philosophy noted. The techniques are categorized according to their output and the inferences that may be drawn from them, in a discursive style without formulae. Methods are compared for four case studies with field data covering a range of types. These are: 1) percentage cover of three shrubs along a line transect; 2) locations and volume of a desert plant in a 1 ha area; 3) a remotely-sensed spectral index and elevation from 105 km2 of a mountainous region; and 4) land cover from three rangeland types within 800 km2 of a coastal region. Initial approaches utilize mapping, frequency distributions and variance-mean indices. Analysis techniques we compare include: local quadrat variance, block quadrat variance, correlograms, variograms, angular correlation, directional variograms, wavelets, SADIE, nearest neighbour methods, Ripley's (t), and various landscape ecology metrics. Our advice to ecologists is to use simple visualization techniques for initial analysis, and subsequently to select methods that are appropriate for the data type and that answer their specific questions of interest. It is usually prudent to employ several different techniques.},

@misc{neal_how_2012,
	abstract = {Consider a Markov chain defined on a finite state space, X, that leaves invariant the uniform distribution on X, and whose transition probabilities are integer multiples of 1/Q, for some integer Q. I show how a simulation of n transitions of this chain starting at x\_0 can be viewed as applying a random permutation on the space XxU, where U=\{0,1,...,Q-1\}, to the start state (x\_0,u\_0), with u\_0 drawn uniformly from U. This result can be applied to a non-uniform distribution with probabilities that are integer multiples of 1/P, for some integer P, by representing it as the marginal distribution for X from the uniform distribution on a suitably-defined subset of XxY, where Y=\{0,1,...,P-1\}. By letting Q, P, and the cardinality of X go to infinity, this result can be generalized to non-rational probabilities and to continuous state spaces, with permutations on a finite space replaced by volume-preserving one-to-one maps from a continuous space to itself. These constructions can be efficiently implemented for chains commonly used in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. I present two applications in this context - simulation of K realizations of a chain from K initial states, but with transitions defined by a single stream of random numbers, as may be efficient with a vector processor or multiple processors, and use of MCMC to improve an importance sampling distribution that already has substantial overlap with the distribution of interest. I also discuss the implications of this "permutation MCMC" method regarding the role of randomness in MCMC simulation, and the potential use of non-random and quasi-random numbers.},

Nevertheless, the resulting approximations are generally as accurate and in some cases more accurate than approximations based on third-order expansions of the likelihood and requiring the evaluation of third derivatives.

@article{homan_no-u-turn_nodate,
	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient ``turnkey'' samplers.},

@article{hu_norges_nodate,
	abstract = {In this paper we propose a new approach for constructing multivariate Gaussian random fields (GRFs) with oscillating covariance functions through systems of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We discuss how to build systems of SPDEs that introduces oscillation characteristics in the covariance functions of the multivariate GRFs. By choosing different parametrization of the equations, some GRFs can be made with oscillating covariance functions but other fields can have Mat´ern covariance functions or close to Mat´ern covariance functions. The multivariate GRFs constructed by solving the systems of SPDEs automatically fulfill the hard requirement of nonnegative definiteness for the covariance functions. The approximate weak solutions to the systems of SPDEs are used to represent the multivariate GRFs by multivariate Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs). Since the multivariate GMRFs have sparse precision matrices (inverse of the covariance matrices), numerical algorithms for sparse matrices can be applied to the precision matrices for sampling and inference. Thus from a computational point of view, the big-n problem can be partially solved with these types of models. Another advantage of the method is that the oscillation in the covariance function can be controlled directly by the parameters in the system of SPDEs. We show how to use this proposed approach with simulated data and real data examples.},

	abstract = {Summary. Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

@article{ackerman_aerial_nodate,
	abstract = {Aerial surveys are used to document the distribution and relative abundance of Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and to assess population trends. Recent research included aerial surveys by various agencies to determine the distributions of manatees in 10 areas of Florida. In most of these studies, twice-monthly flights were made for at least 2 years. Surveys of distributions have now been made in all areas of the state that are extensively used by manatees. The resulting data have been used for the protection of manatees. Various groups conducted counts of manatees at aggregation sites in winter at selected power plants and at the Crystal River and Blue Spring. These counts have been used to assess population-size trends. Based on mandates by the state legislature, a 2-day, synoptic aerial survey was made to obtain a single annual high count by maximizing survey effort under optimal conditions. These surveys followed two major cold fronts each winter in 1991 and 1992. On 17-18 January 1992, a high count of I,856 manatees was made (907 on the eastern coast, 949 on the western coast, 8.7\% calves). Although not statistical estimates, these counts provide new information about the minimum size ofthe population. The higher synoptic-survey counts are not proof of an increase of the population through time but are consistent with increases in long-term counts in some areas of the state, including aerial counts at the Crystal River, ground counts at Blue Spring, and counts of aggregations at power plants adjusted for temperature covariates. Current research on aerial surveys is focused on new techniques to improve estimates of population size and trend.},

The purpose of this research is to explore the effect of direct spatial correlation structures on crash frequency models at the road segment level and compare them to spatial conditional models. By using direct spatial correlation structures the ``effective range'' (i.e., the distance at which there is no lingering spatial correlation) is estimated. Full Bayes hierarchical models with direct spatial correlation effects and conditional autoregressive (CAR) spatial effects are estimated. The model of crash, traffic, and roadway inventory data from Pennsylvania shows an average effective range of around 168 m which is in line with previous findings from conditional models. The direct spatial correlation model has a better goodness of fit than the random effects and the CAR model. Furthermore, the proportion of variation in the data explained by the spatial correlation term is almost the same for both spatial models. The standard deviations in coefficient estimates are slightly lower for the direct spatial correlation model compared to the random effects model but significantly lower than the CAR model.},

@article{martinez-minaya_dealing_2019,
	abstract = {Worldwide, cetacean species have started to be protected, but they are still very vulnerable to accidental damage from an expanding range of human activities at sea. To properly manage these potential threats we need a detailed understanding of the seasonal distributions of these highly mobile populations. To achieve this goal, a growing effort has been underway to develop species distribution models (SDMs) that correctly describe and predict preferred species areas. However, accuracy is not always easy to achieve when physical barriers, such as islands, are present. Indeed, SDMs assume, if only implicitly, that the spatial effect is stationary, and that correlation is only dependent on the distance between observations and not on the direction or a spatial coordinates. The application of stationary SDMs in these cases could lead to incorrect predictions and, consequently, to uninformed decision making. In this study, we identify vulnerable habitats for the bottlenose dolphin in the Archipelago de La Maddalena, Northern Sardinia (Italy) using Bayesian hierarchical SDMs that account for the physical barriers issue and provide a full specification of the associated uncertainty. The approach we propose constitutes a major step forward in the understanding of cetacean species in many ecosystems where physical, geographical and topographical barriers are present.},

An old approximate technique is the Laplace method or approximation, which dates back to Pierre-Simon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates the integrand with a second-order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain the approach of integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to do approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs represent an important model abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a large proportion of the statistical models used today.

	abstract = {Coming up with Bayesian models for spatial data is easy, but performing inference with them can be challenging. Writing fast inference code for a complex spatial model with realistically‐sized datasets from scratch is time‐consuming, and if changes are made to the model, there is little guarantee that the code performs well. The key advantages of R‐INLA are the ease with which complex models can be created and modified, without the need to write complex code, and the speed at which inference can be done even for spatial problems with hundreds of thousands of observations. R‐INLA handles latent Gaussian models, where fixed effects, structured and unstructured Gaussian random effects are combined linearly in a linear predictor, and the elements of the linear predictor are observed through one or more likelihoods. The structured random effects can be both standard areal model such as the Besag and the BYM models, and geostatistical models from a subset of the Mat{\'e}rn Gaussian random fields. In this review, we discuss the large success of spatial modeling with R‐INLA and the types of spatial models that can be fitted, we give an overview of recent developments for areal models, and we give an overview of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach and some of the ways it can be extended beyond the assumptions of isotropy and separability. In particular, we describe how slight changes to the SPDE approach leads to straight‐forward approaches for nonstationary spatial models and nonseparable space--time models.

	abstract = {The INLA package provides a tool for computationally efficient Bayesian modeling and inference for various widely used models, more formally the class of latent Gaussian models. It is a non-sampling based framework which provides approximate results for Bayesian inference, using sparse matrices. The swift uptake of this framework for Bayesian modeling is rooted in the computational efficiency of the approach and catalyzed by the demand presented by the big data era. In this paper, we present new developments within the INLA package with the aim to provide a computationally efficient mechanism for the Bayesian inference of relevant challenging situations.},

	abstract = {Regionalization is to divide a set of spatial objects into a number of spatially contiguous regions while optimizing an objective function, which is usually a homogeneity (or etereogenity) measure of the derived regions. In this paper we propose a new regionalization method for spatial functional data by means of a Dynamic Clustering Algorithm. The method optimizes a criterion of spatial association among functional data, it is such that the prototype is a trace-semivariogram model chosen from a set of mathematical functions that describes spatial relationships. The appropriate model is chosen by matching the shape of the curve of the experimental variogram to the shape of the curve of the mathematical function. Performances of these methods are checked through an application on real data.},

@article{verdoy_title_nodate-1,
	abstract = {Wildfires play an important role in shaping landscapes and as a source of CO2 and particulate matter, and are a typical spatial point process studied in many papers. Modeling the spatial variability of a wildfire could be performed in different ways and an important issue is the computational facilities that the new techniques afford us. The most common approaches have been through point pattern analysis or by Markov random fields. These methods have made it possible to build risk maps, but for many forest managers it is very useful to know the size of the fire as well as its location. In this work, we use Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) with Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) to model the size of the forest fires observed in the Valencian Community, Spain. But the most important element in this paper is the process that needs to be carried out prior to simulating and analyzing the different point patterns, namely, the choice of the most suitable mesh for the database. We describe and take advantage of the Bayesian methodology by including INLA and SPDE in the modeling process in all the scenarios.},

@article{chaudhuri_modeling_2023-1,
	abstract = {Natural hazards like floods, cyclones, earthquakes, or, tsunamis have deep impacts on the environment and society causing damage to both life and property. These events can cause widespread destruction and can lead to long-term socio-economic disruption often affecting the most vulnerable populations in society. Computational modeling provides an essential tool to estimate the damage by incorporating spatial uncertainties and examining global risk assessments. Classical stationary models in spatial statistics often assume isotropy and stationarity. It causes inappropriate smoothing over features having boundaries, holes, or physical barriers. Despite this, nonstationary models like barrier model have been little explored in the context of natural disasters in complex land structures. The principal objective of the current study is to evaluate the influence of barrier models compared to classical stationary models by analysing the incidence of natural disasters in complex spatial regions like islands and coastal areas. In the current study, we have used tsunami records from the island nation of Maldives. For seven atoll groups considered in our study, we have implemented three distinct categories of stochastic partial differential equation meshes, two for stationary models and one that corresponds to the barrier model concept. The results show that when assessing the spatial variance of tsunami incidence at the atoll scale, the barrier model outperforms the other two models while maintaining the same computational cost as the stationary models. In the broader picture, this research work contributes to the relatively new field of nonstationary barrier models and intends to establish a robust modeling framework to explore spatial phenomena, particularly natural hazards, in complex spatial regions having physical barriers.},

	abstract = {Seventy dugongs were fitted with satellite PTTs and/or GPS transmitters in sub-tropical and tropical waters of Queensland and the Northern Territory, Australia. Twenty-eight of the 70 dugongs were also fitted with time-depth recorders. The dugongs were tracked for periods ranging from 15 to 551 days and exhibited a large range of individualistic movement behaviours; 26 individuals were relatively sedentary (moving {\textless} 15 km) while 44 made large-scale movements ({\textgreater} 15 km) of up to 560 km from their capture sites. Male and female animals, including cows with calves, exhibited large-scale movements (LSM; {\textgreater} 15 km). Body length of travelling dugongs ranged from 1.9 to 3 m. At least some of the movements were return movements to the capture location, suggesting that such movements were ranging rather than dispersal movements. LSMs included macro-scale regional movements ({\textgreater} 100 km) and meso-scale inter-patch local movements (15 to {\textless} 100 km) and were qualitatively different from tidally-driven micro-scale commuting movements between and within seagrass beds ({\textless}15 km). The mean $\pm$ S.E. macro-scale movement distance per individual was 243.8 $\pm$ 35.4 km (N = 14 individuals that travelled {\textgreater} 100 km), with a mean $\pm$ S.E. travel time of 179.8 $\pm$ 29.0 h. The mean $\pm$ S.E. meso-scale movement distance per individual was 49.7 $\pm$ 3.3 km (N = 28 individuals that made movements of 15--100 km), with a mean $\pm$ S.E. travel time of 52.3 $\pm$ 7.1 h. LSMs were rapid and apparently directed (mean $\pm$ S.E. travel speeds for GPS tagged animals; meso-scale movements = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.11 km/h, min = 0.3, max = 3.0; macro-scale movements = 1.6 $\pm$ 0.16 km/h, min = 0.8, max = 1.3). Tracked dugongs rarely travelled far from the coast (mean $\pm$ S.E. max distance = 12.8 $\pm$ 1.3 km). Dive profiles from the time-depth recorders suggest that dugongs make repeated deep dives while travelling rather than remaining at the surface, increasing their likelihood of capture in bottom set gill nets. Some animals caught in the high latitude limits of the dugongs' range on the Australian east coast in winter apparently undertook long distance movements in response to low water temperatures, similar to migrational movements by Florida manatees. Our findings that dugongs frequently undertake macro-scale movements have implications for management at a range of scales, and strengthen the aerial survey and genetic evidence for management and monitoring at ecological scales that cross jurisdictions.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT 
              Quantifying the factors influencing behaviors of aquatic mammalian grazers may enhance the generic understanding of grazer ecology. We investigated diel and tidal patterns in movements of the dugong (
              Dugong dugon
              ) by Global Positioning System---tracking 12 animals in 5 inshore---intertidal and 3 offshore---subtidal habitats along the coast of Queensland, Australia. We examined effects of tide height and time of day on the dugong's distance from 1) the nearest coast, 2) water {\textgreater}3 m deep, 3) actual water depth (bathymetry + tide ht) experienced, and 4) distribution of the directions of movements. Both tidal and diel cycles influenced dugong movement. Tracked dugongs tended to be closer to shore at high tide than at low tide and closer to shore at night than during the day. Onshore movement was more prevalent on incoming tides and in the afternoon and evening. Offshore movement was more prevalent on outgoing tides and from midnight through the morning until midday. Tidal and diel variation in water depths used by the inshore---intertidal dugongs was small, but probably underestimated, hidden by a sampling bias in the telemetry equipment. Onshore movement at high tide allowed dugongs to exploit intertidal seagrass beds. Dugongs are closer to shore in afternoons and evenings than in mornings. This behavior may be related to the avoidance of predators or watercraft. Our findings can be used to predict spatial patterns of dugongs within areas of conservation management significance and to assess, avoid, and mitigate adverse effects of anthropogenic disturbance.},

@article{sheppard_dugong_2010,
	abstract = {The dugong is the only herbivorous mammal that is strictly marine and a seagrass community specialist. The pasture available to the dugong varies with the tides because seagrass occurs in both intertidal and subtidal areas. We GPS-tracked seven dugongs within a 24 km2, intensively used seagrass habitat in subtropical Australia in winter. We modeled resource selection within the habitat by comparing the dugongs' use of space with the distribution of seagrass in an area defined using the combined space-use of the tracked animals. Selection by dugongs for seagrass quantity (biomass) and quality (nutrients) was analyzed within six time/tide combinations to examine the influences of tidal periodicity and the diel cycle on resource selection. Dugong habitat use was consistently centered over seagrass patches with high nitrogen concentrations, except during the day at low tides when the animals had fewer habitat choices and their space use was centered over high seagrass biomass. The association of dugongs with seagrass high in starch was positive during both day and night high tides when the animals could access the intertidal areas where seagrass biomass was generally low. Associations between dugongs and seagrass species were less definite, reflecting the potential for dugongs to exploit several species. Our model of dugong resource selection suggests that nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient for dugong populations and also confirms the preference of dugongs for high-energy foods.},

@article{horsak_dispersal_2025,
	abstract = {The biota of North Atlantic islands evokes intriguing questions on its evolution, colonisation routes, and an equilibrium between dispersal limitation and climatic/habitat constraints. While good data on non-marine snails exist for most of the islands, the data for Greenland were observed mainly between 1850 and 1900. The recorded species have been described as Greenland endemics, but this conclusion has never been fully questioned based on evidence. It can be assumed that these passively dispersing invertebrates are in fact of North American origin, due to the shortest distance to the mainland across the Davis Strait. To answer these questions, we collected the snail fauna at 72 sites of five locations across west Greenland. Our sampling revealed a very species-poor fauna, consisting of two aquatic and four terrestrial snail species. Based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences, the phylogenetic reconstruction and haplotype analysis showed that these taxa are either North American (all aquatic) or European (all terrestrial) in origin. None of them appeared to be endemic to Greenland and they were not even genetically distinct from the mainland populations. At both the macro and habitat scale, the Greenland snail fauna was found to be only a small fraction of the mainland species pool based on climate mapping and analysis of habitat requirements. While it appears to be limited mainly by dispersal, a detailed analysis of bird migration routes and intensity could not explain a puzzling difference in the biogeographical origin of the aquatic and terrestrial components. Terrestrial snails mimic the pattern seen in non-flying beetles, while the aquatic that of some flying insects. The results are a strong reminder that simple linear distance does not make a barrier, and that the barrier permeability can differ even within a group sharing the same dispersal mode and potential.},

@article{heino_metacommunity_2015,
	abstract = {Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. Species sorting (i.e. species are `filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmentally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by `mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this difference may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

@article{badgley_ecological_2000,
	abstract = {Aim To evaluate the relationship of climate and physiography to species density and ecological diversity of North American mammals. Location North America, including Mexico and Central America. Methods Species density, size structure and trophic structure of mammalian faunas and nine environmental variables were documented for quadrats covering the entire continent. Spatial autocorrelation of species density and the environmental variables illustrated differences in their spatial structure at the continental scale. We used principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the climatic variables, linear multiple regression to determine which environmental variables best predict species density for the continent and several regions of the continent, and canonical ordination to evaluate how well the environmental variables predict ecological structure of mammalian faunas over North America. Results In the best regression model, five environmental variables, representing seasonal extremes of temperature, annual energy and moisture, and elevation, predicted 88\% of the variation in species density for the whole continent. Among different regions of North America, the environmental variables that predicted species density vary. Changes in the size and trophic structure of mammalian faunas accompany changes in species density. Redundancy analysis demonstrated that environmental variables representing winter temperature, frostfree period, potential and actual evapotranspiration, and elevation account for 77\% of the variation in ecological structure. Main conclusions The latitudinal gradient in mammalian species density is strong, but most of it is explained by variation in the environmental variables. Each ecological category peaks in species richness under particular environmental conditions. The changes of greatest magnitude involve the smallest size categories ({\textless} 10 g, 11--100 g), aerial insectivores and frugivores. Species in these categories, mostly bats, increase along a gradient of decreasing winter temperature and increasing annual moisture and frostfree period, trends correlated with latitude. At the opposite end of this gradient, species in the largest size category (101--1000 kg) increase in frequency. Species in size categories 3 (101--1000 g), 5 (11--100 kg) and 6 (101--1000 kg), herbivores, and granivores increase along a longitudinal gradient of increasing annual potential evapotranspiration and elevation. Much of the spatial pattern is consistent with ecological sorting of species ranges along environmental gradients, but differential rates of speciation and extinction also may have shaped the ecological diversity of extant North American mammals.},

	abstract = {The spatial heterogeneity of populations and communities plays a central role in many ecological theories, for instance the theories of succession, adaptation, maintenance of species diversity, community stability, competition, predator-prey interactions, parasitism, epidemics and other natural catastrophes, ergoclines, and so on. This paper will review how the spatial structure of biological populations and communities can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Methods now available for analysing the spatial structure of biological populations are described, and illustrated by vegetation data. These include various methods to test for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial correlograms, and two-dimensional spectral analysis), and the multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other descriptive methods of spatial structure: the univariate variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test, presented here as a way of studying causal models that include space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering). A table shows the methods classified in terms of the ecological questions they allow to resolve. Reference is made to available computer programs.},

@article{cowen_larval_2009,
	abstract = {Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with complex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they occupy hamper our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Evidence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed dispersal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differential postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental ecological processes that affect population regulation and persistence. Finally, a full understanding of population connectivity has important applications for management and conservation.},

@article{grantham_dispersal_2003,
	abstract = {Life-history parameters were used to estimate the dispersal potential of 1021 marine macroinvertebrates recorded in species lists from 91 sites comprising rocky intertidal, subtidal, kelp forest, sandy beach, and soft-bottom habitats in Washington, Oregon, and California. Mean species richness was significantly greater in the California rocky subtidal habitat. Data on development mode, planktonic larval duration, rafting potential, and adult mobility were compiled, and summaries of the dispersal potentials of taxa within each habitat type were generated and compared. In summary, development mode was known or estimated for 76\% of species; larval planktonic duration for 49\%; adult mobility for 76\%; and rafting potential for 46\%. In comparisons of species' life-history traits among habitats, sand-dominated habitats were distinct from rocky habitats. In rocky habitats, ∼42\% of species had planktonic feeding larvae, 43\% had planktonic nonfeeding larvae, and 15\% had nonplanktonic larvae. Sandy intertidal habitats had higher proportions of taxa with nondispersing, nonplanktonic larvae and lower proportions of planktonic feeding and nonfeeding larvae than all other sites. Soft-bottom subtidal communities had the highest proportion of taxa with planktonic feeding development and larvae with planktonic lifespans {\textgreater}30 d. Species in soft-bottom subtidal sites, therefore, have the greatest potential for extensive larval dispersal, whereas species in soft-bottom intertidal sites have the least potential for larval dispersal. In these sites with limited larval dispersal potential, there is greater potential for adult dispersal through adult movement and rafting. These differences in the dispersal potential of larvae and adults suggest that the effect of environmental changes and the effectiveness of reserves may differ between habitats. Conservation methods, including the use of marine reserves, must therefore be tailored to the habitat of interest if effective protection of community resources is to be achieved.},

@article{nislow_variation_2011,
	abstract = {1. Barriers to immigration, all else being equal, should in principle depress local abundance and reduce local species richness. These issues are particularly relevant to stream-dwelling species when improperly designed road crossings act as barriers to migration with potential impacts on the viability of upstream populations. However, because abundance and richness are highly spatially and temporally heterogeneous and the relative importance of immigration on demography is uncertain, population- and community-level effects can be difficult to detect. 2. In this study, we tested the effects of potential barriers to upstream movements on the local abundance and species richness of a diverse assemblage of resident stream fishes in the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, U.S.A. Fishes were sampled using simple standard techniques above- and below road crossings that were either likely or unlikely to be barriers to upstream fish movements (based on physical dimensions of the crossing). We predicted that abundance of resident fishes would be lower in the upstream sections of streams with predicted impassable barriers, that the strength of the effect would vary among species and that variable effects on abundance would translate into lower species richness. 3. Supporting these predictions, the statistical model that best accounted for variation in abundance and species richness included a significant interaction between location (upstream or downstream of crossing) and type (passable or impassable crossing). Stream sections located above predicated impassable culverts had fewer than half the number of species and less than half the total fish abundance, while stream sections above and below passable culverts had essentially equivalent richness and abundance. 4. Our results are consistent with the importance of immigration and population connectivity to local abundance and species richness of stream fishes. In turn, these results suggest that when measured at appropriate scales (multiple streams within catchments), with simple protocols amenable to use by management agencies, differences in local abundance and species richness may serve as indicators of the extent to which road crossings are barriers to fish movement and help determine whether road-crossing improvements have restored connectivity to stream fish populations and communities.},

Greater understanding of how these structures affect aquatic organisms is needed to ensure that decisions regarding their construction and removal strike an appropriate balance between components of human and ecosystem services. Within the basin of the Laurentian Great Lakes, the effects that in-stream barriers (dams) used to control the nonnative, parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) on the diversity of non-target fishes is a significant concern for fishery managers. A previous study indicated that upstream changes in the species richness of non-target fishes observed in 24 streams with a sea lamprey barrier relative to paired reference streams (a measure of effect size) was variable across the basin. We examined the degree to which the variance in effect size could be attributed to imprecision in the field sampling protocol used to estimate effect sizes, differences in catchment-scale landscape attributes between barrier and reference streams within pairs, and differences in landscape attributes at different spatial scales among barrier streams. Simulation modeling and analyses of repeated field measurements made for a subset of streams demonstrated that a large variance in effect size is expected for the field sampling design and that estimates of effect size measured for individual barrier streams are imprecise. Regression models and multi-model inference methods based on Akaike's Information Criterion provided less support for hypotheses linking effect size to landscape attributes. Mean effect size, adjusted for the influences of landscape characteristics within and across stream pairs, provides the most reliable and least biased estimate of the effect of sea lamprey barriers on the richness of non-target fish species. With the information currently available, landscape characteristics of catchments cannot be used to help decision makers anticipate effects sizes for candidate streams being considered for future barrier construction. Our findings will help fishery managers in the Laurentian Great Lakes make more informed decisions regarding the use and placement of sea lamprey barriers and achieve their objective of delivering an integrated pest management plan for sea lamprey control that is environmentally and economically sound and socially acceptable.},

	abstract = {We examined the effects of dams on freshwater fish species based on data collected during 1990--2004 from 200 drainage systems in Japan. Of the 76 fish species examined, the occurrence of 20 species within Petromyzontidae, Cyprinidae, Cobitididae, Salmonidae, Cottidae, and Gobiidae was negatively affected by the presence of dams located in the downstream reaches of fish survey sites, whereas the occurrence of 12 species within Cyprinidae, Adrianichthyidae, Centrarchidae, and Gobiidae was positively associated with the presence of dams. A significantly higher proportion of the fishes with a negative damming effect were diadromous species as compared to the fishes with a positive damming effect. Conversely, the latter group had a significantly higher proportion of nonnative species than the former. A significant interaction existed between the effects of damming and the effects of elevation on family-specific species richness. Families dominated by native migratory species showed a greater reduction in the number of species above dams at lower elevations, whereas families represented primarily by nonnative species had higher species richness above dams at higher elevations, except for Centrarchidae, which was always higher in species richness above dams regardless of elevation. Based on our findings, dams in Japan have adversely affected native freshwater fishes by blocking their migration routes, favoring nonnative fishes, or altering existing habitats.},

@article{morita_population_2002,
	abstract = {Throughout the world, rivers are increasingly fragmented by artificial barriers, such as damming and road crossing. In Japanese mountain streams, most populations of white-spotted charr, a salmonid fish, are highly fragmented by numerous small dams. Most of these dams were constructed after 1970. In this study, we conducted a population viability analysis of fragmented white-spotted charr populations using a simple individual based model. The constructed model is age-structured and density dependent that incorporates both demographic and environmental stochasticity. The probability of population persistence decreased substantially between after 30 years and after 100 years, especially for populations having a small carrying capacity. Even though white-spotted charr occupies many fragmented habitats now, our results suggest small fragmented populations are not viable. A sensitivity analysis showed that adult survival, not juvenile survival and egg number, was the most important criterion for the prospects of population persistence. Installations of efficient fish ladders or dam removal are necessary as soon as possible to restore dammed-off populations.},

@article{letcher_population_2007,
	abstract = {Fragmentation can strongly influence population persistence and expression of life-history strategies in spatially-structured populations. In this study, we directly estimated size-specific dispersal, growth, and survival of stream-dwelling brook trout in a stream network with connected and naturally-isolated tributaries. We used multiple-generation, individual-based data to develop and parameterize a size-class and location-based population projection model, allowing us to test effects of fragmentation on population dynamics at local (i.e., subpopulation) and system-wide (i.e., metapopulation) scales, and to identify demographic rates which influence the persistence of isolated and fragmented populations. In the naturally-isolated tributary, persistence was associated with higher early juvenile survival (∼45\% greater), shorter generation time (one-half) and strong selection against large body size compared to the open system, resulting in a stage-distribution skewed towards younger, smaller fish. Simulating barriers to upstream migration into two currently-connected tributary populations caused rapid (2--6 generations) local extinction. These local extinctions in turn increased the likelihood of system-wide extinction, as tributaries could no longer function as population sources. Extinction could be prevented in the open system if sufficient immigrants from downstream areas were available, but the influx of individuals necessary to counteract fragmentation effects was high (7--46\% of the total population annually). In the absence of sufficient immigration, a demographic change (higher early survival characteristic of the isolated tributary) was also sufficient to rescue the population from fragmentation, suggesting that the observed differences in size distributions between the naturally-isolated and open system may reflect an evolutionary response to isolation. Combined with strong genetic divergence between the isolated tributary and open system, these results suggest that local adaptation can `rescue' isolated populations, particularly in one-dimensional stream networks where both natural and anthropogenically-mediated isolation is common. However, whether rescue will occur before extinction depends critically on the race between adaptation and reduced survival in response to fragmentation.},

@article{pepino_fish_2012,
	abstract = {Dispersal is a key determinant of the spatial distribution and abundance of populations, but human-made fragmentation can create barriers that hinder dispersal and reduce population viability. This study presents a modeling framework based on dispersal kernels (modified Laplace distributions) that describe stream fish dispersal in the presence of obstacles to passage. We used mark--recapture trials to quantify summer dispersal of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in four streams crossed by a highway. The analysis identified population heterogeneity in dispersal behavior, as revealed by the presence of a dominant sedentary component (48--72\% of all individuals) characterized by short mean dispersal distance ({\textless}10 m), and a secondary mobile component characterized by longer mean dispersal distance (56--1086 m). We did not detect evidence of barrier effects on dispersal through highway crossings. Simulation of various plausible scenarios indicated that detectability of barrier effects was strongly dependent on features of sampling design, such as spatial configuration of the sampling area, barrier extent, and sample size. The proposed modeling framework extends conventional dispersal kernels by incorporating structural barriers. A major strength of the approach is that ecological process (dispersal model) and sampling design (observation model) are incorporated simultaneously into the analysis. This feature can facilitate the use of prior knowledge to improve sampling efficiency of mark--recapture trials in movement studies. Model-based estimation of barrier permeability and its associated uncertainty provides a rigorous approach for quantifying the effect of barriers on stream fish dispersal and assessing population dynamics of stream fish in fragmented landscapes.},

	abstract = {According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the status of European surface waters is assessed using aquatic organism groups. Here we present an overview of 297 assessment methods, based on a questionnaire survey addressing authorities in all countries implementing the WFD. Twenty-eight countries reported on methods applied to rivers (30\%), coastal waters (26\%), lakes (25\%) and transitional waters (19\%). More than half of the methods are based on macroscopic plants (28\%) or benthic invertebrates (26\%); in addition, phytoplankton (21\%), fish (15\%) and phytobenthos (10\%) were assessed. Countries of Central and Western Europe had developed almost all methods required for the WFD implementation. Two main sampling strategies were discernable: small-scale sampling of the taxonomically diverse groups of benthic invertebrates and phytobenthos that demand elaborate processing, versus large-scale sampling of vast, species-poor plant stands or the mobile fish fauna. About three-quarters of methods identified organisms to species-level while in particular phytoplankton-based methods used class- or phylum-level, or included no taxonomic information. Out of nine metric types distinguished, river methods used more sensitivity and trait metrics while for other water categories abundance metrics prevailed. Fish-based methods showed the highest number of metrics. Fifty-six percent of methods focussed on the detection of eutrophication and organic pollution, with shares decreasing from autotrophic to heterotrophic organism groups: phytoplankton{\textgreater}phytobenthos{\textgreater}macroscopic plants{\textgreater}benthic invertebrates{\textgreater}fish fauna. The order was almost reverse for hydrological or morphological deterioration: fish fauna and macroscopic plants{\textgreater}benthic invertebrates{\textgreater}phytoplankton{\textgreater}phytobenthos. These pressures were mainly assessed by methods applied to rivers and transitional waters. The pressure-impact relationship of about one-third of methods was not tested empirically with methods for transitional waters being the least validated. The strength of relationships differed significantly between organism groups and water categories. The correlation coefficients generally covered a broad range ({\textless}0.4 to {\textgreater}0.8), but on average with the pattern: phytoplankton{\textgreater}macroscopic plants{\textgreater}benthic invertebrates{\textgreater}phytobenthos and fish fauna. In terms of water categories the following order resulted: coastal waters{\textgreater}lakes{\textgreater}transitional waters{\textgreater}rivers. Status boundaries were mostly defined using statistical approaches. We advocate better reflection of the necessary sampling effort and precision, full validations of pressure-impact relationships and an implementation of more ecological components into classification.},

@article{moritz_disentangling_2013,
	abstract = {Dispersal is a key process in metacommunity dynamics, allowing the maintenance of diversity in complex community networks. Geographic distance is usually used as a surrogate for connectivity implying that communities that are closely located are considered more prone to exchange individuals than distant communities. However, in some natural systems, organisms may be subjected to directional dispersal (air or water flows, particular landscape configuration), possibly leading close communities to be isolated from each other and distant communities to be connected. Using geographic distance as a proxy for realised connectivity may then yield misleading results regarding the role of dispersal in structuring communities in such systems. Here, we quantified the relative importance of flow connectivity, geographic distance, and environmental gradients to explain polychaete metacommunity structure along the coasts of the Gulf of Lions (northwest Mediterranean Sea). Flow connectivity was estimated by Lagrangian particle dispersal simulations. Our results revealed that this metacommunity is strongly structured by the environment at large spatial scales, and that both flow connectivity and geographic distance play an important role within homogeneous environments at smaller spatial scales. We thus strongly advocate for a wider use of connectivity measures, in addition to geographic distance, to study spatial patterns of biological diversity (e.g. distance decay) and to infer the processes behind these patterns at different spatial scales. Synthesis Everything is connected, but connections are seldom accurately quantified. Biological communities are often studied separately, using observations, experiments and models to unravel local dynamics of organisms interacting with each other. However, regional processes such as dispersal through ocean and air circulation, likely to connect distant communities and influence their local dynamics, are not always accounted for, or, at best, used as an homogeneous and distance-related factor. Ocean models have being extensively developed and validated during the past decades with the increasing availability of accurate meteorological data. Using such model outputs, precise quantifi cation of exchange rates of organisms between communities was performed in a marine Mediterranean coastal area. Jointly with local environmental and biological data, these results were used to quantify the effects of realistic connectivity on local and regional polychaete community structure, and revealed that the environmental gradient, geographic distance, and connectivity were responsible for community structure at different spatial scales.},

@article{nislow_variation_2011-1,
	abstract = {1. Barriers to immigration, all else being equal, should in principle depress local abundance and reduce local species richness. These issues are particularly relevant to stream-dwelling species when improperly designed road crossings act as barriers to migration with potential impacts on the viability of upstream populations. However, because abundance and richness are highly spatially and temporally heterogeneous and the relative importance of immigration on demography is uncertain, population- and community-level effects can be difficult to detect. 2. In this study, we tested the effects of potential barriers to upstream movements on the local abundance and species richness of a diverse assemblage of resident stream fishes in the Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia, U.S.A. Fishes were sampled using simple standard techniques above- and below road crossings that were either likely or unlikely to be barriers to upstream fish movements (based on physical dimensions of the crossing). We predicted that abundance of resident fishes would be lower in the upstream sections of streams with predicted impassable barriers, that the strength of the effect would vary among species and that variable effects on abundance would translate into lower species richness. 3. Supporting these predictions, the statistical model that best accounted for variation in abundance and species richness included a significant interaction between location (upstream or downstream of crossing) and type (passable or impassable crossing). Stream sections located above predicated impassable culverts had fewer than half the number of species and less than half the total fish abundance, while stream sections above and below passable culverts had essentially equivalent richness and abundance. 4. Our results are consistent with the importance of immigration and population connectivity to local abundance and species richness of stream fishes. In turn, these results suggest that when measured at appropriate scales (multiple streams within catchments), with simple protocols amenable to use by management agencies, differences in local abundance and species richness may serve as indicators of the extent to which road crossings are barriers to fish movement and help determine whether road-crossing improvements have restored connectivity to stream fish populations and communities.},

@article{shurin_spatial_2009,
	abstract = {Dispersal can limit the ranges of species and the diversity of communities. Despite its importance, little is known about its role in freshwater habitats and its relation to habitat type (lentic vs. lotic), especially for organisms with cryptic dispersal methods such as plankton. Poor dispersers are expected to show more clumped distributions or greater spatial autocorrelation (SA) in community composition than good dispersers. We examined patterns of SA across freshwater taxa with different dispersal modes (active vs. passive) and their association with habitat type (lake vs. stream) using 18 spatially explicit community composition data sets. We found significant relationships between SA and body size among taxa in lake habitats, but not in streams. However, the increase in SA with body size in lakes was driven entirely by fishes---organisms ranging in size from diatoms to macro-invertebrates showed equivalent levels of SA. These results support the idea that large organisms are less effective dispersers in aquatic environments, resulting in greater SA in community structure over broad scales. Streams may be effectively more connected than lakes as patterns of SA and body size were weaker in lotic habitats. Our data suggest that the critical threshold where greater body size increases dispersal limitation seems to come at the juncture between invertebrates and vertebrates rather than that between unicellular and multicellular organisms as has been previously suggested.},

@article{marsden_evaluation_2023,
	abstract = {A key challenge in fishery restoration strategies is prioritising fish passage remediation efforts to achieve optimal ecological and socio-economic outcomes. Various methodologies have been developed for assessing and prioritising the mitigation of fish passage barriers, but they have been designed for developed countries where site data and/or other resources are often readily available. We evaluated a new practical, low-cost basin-scale approach --- referred to as the Fish Barrier Prioritisation Support System (FBPSS) --- for assessing and prioritising the remediation of fish passage barriers of all types (i.e. large dams, small irrigation structures and road crossings) in resource-deficient settings, like those typical of developing countries. The FBPSS applies a five-stage decision-support framework to prioritise barriers for remediation based on geospatial, biological and socio-economic criteria. The stages involve identifying all potential barriers within the target basin using satellite imagery; conducting GIS analysis to rank the barriers for further investigation; field-validating the highest ranked barriers to ground-truth the GIS analysis results; identifying the highest priority field-validated barriers affecting fisheries productivity; and further refining the list according to socio-economic considerations. We applied the FBPSS to the Bago catchment in Myanmar as a case study, and then validated its effectiveness by comparing the fragmentation impacts (as measured by the Dendritic Connectivity Index) of the FBPSS-prioritised large dams with those of all large dams. The FBPSS successfully identified 876 potential barriers in the Bago catchment, and then systematically assessed these barriers using its filters to produce a prioritised list of 23 barriers for cost-effectively achieving optimal fishery and community benefits. The validation analysis revealed that the high priority FBPSS-combined barriers were responsible for 97--100\% of the fragmentation of the combined barriers (with all large dams included). Our findings suggest that the FBPSS could be used as a practical decision support tool, in conjunction with expert knowledge, for prioritising the mitigation of fish passage barriers in resource-deficient settings. Future research could compare the results of the FBPSS with those of an optimisation model to assess how the two approaches perform under different scenarios, and to identify key modelling features that could potentially be integrated into the FBPSS.},

@article{jones_selective_2021,
	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is a principal threat to biodiversity and artificial river barriers are a leading cause of the global decline in freshwater biota. Although the impact of barriers on diadromous fish is well established, impacts on river-resident fish communities remain unclear, especially for low-head barriers. We examined the movement of five contrasting freshwater fish (topmouth gudgeon, European minnow, stone loach, bullhead and brown trout) in an experimental cascade mesocosm with seven pools separated by small vertical barriers. Passage rates differed significantly among species and increased with body size and sustained swimming speed (Usus), ranging from an average of 0.2 passes/hr in topmouth gudgeon to 3.4 passes/hr in brown trout. A random-walk simulation indicated that barriers can result in net downstream movement and shifts in community composition. Passage rates in brown trout were leptokurtic, that is, most individuals were relatively sedentary while a small proportion showed frequent movements. Upstream passage rates of brown trout increased with body length and boldness while fish with lower aerobic scope tended to move downstream. Passage rates showed significant individual repeatability in brown trout, independent of body size, indicating the potential for in-stream barriers to exert selective effects on fish populations. Our results show that barrier effects can be more complex than simply blocking fish passage, and that river-resident fish can be impacted even by very small barriers. We show that fish passage depends on a wide range of morphological, physiological and behavioural drivers, and that barriers can exert selective effects on these traits and cause shifts in community composition. Policy implications. Barrier mitigation measures need to embrace interspecific and intraspecific variation in fish passage to avoid inadvertent artificial selection on fish communities. Given the high abundance of low-head structures in river systems worldwide, a paradigm shift is needed to recognise the subtle impacts of small barriers on freshwater biodiversity. Removal of small barriers or nature-like fishways should allow better passage of the wider fish community compared to widely used salmonid-centric fish passage options.},

@article{wang_mapping_2021,
	abstract = {Aim Holistic marine biodiversity conservation refers to ecosystem-based management through marine conservation planning (MCP), based on mapping habitat protection priority areas. In practice, MCP is frequently hindered by information gaps in biodiversity distributions, particularly on a marine ecoregion scale. Species distribution modelling (SDM) can help to resolve this gap and provide information essential for MCP scenarios. We constructed habitat configurations for three coastal marine megafauna animals using SDM, then based MCP scenarios on the projected habitat configurations and tested the use of marine megafauna animals as surrogates to protect major ecosystems. Location Gulf of Thailand, Southeast Asia. Methods A MaxEnt model was used to project likely habitats for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) and sea turtles in the Gulf of Thailand. MARXAN software was used to prioritize spatial configurations for habitat protection. The percentage of overlaps between MARXAN delineations and major biodiversity features in the Gulf of Thailand were calculated. Results Habitat configurations of humpback dolphins, Irrawaddy dolphins and sea turtles were projected throughout the coastal and estuarine waters along the Gulf of Thailand. MCP based on the habitat of three marine megafauna animals highlighted five critical habitats for the protection of major ecosystems in the Gulf of Thailand. Main conclusions Holistic MCP starts with mapping critical habitats for marine protected area (MPA) networks, balances MPA networks with maritime livelihood activities and alleviates conflicts between MPA management and local livelihood needs. A combination of SDM and MARXAN methods provides a cost-effective approach to delineate MPA networks. In this approach, surrogate selection and data preparation should consider niches representative of regional ecosystem features and avoid spatial sampling bias. In coastal and estuarine waters, marine megafauna such as coastal cetaceans and sea turtles may serve as efficient surrogates to protect major ecosystems.},

Yet, they face threats from overfishing, pollution, habitat degradation, and climate change, and one-third of marine megafauna species are at risk of extinction, ultimately endangering the resilience of entire ecosystems. In such a context, knowing when and where megafauna find resources to balance their substantial energy requirements is critical for their management. Through an energyscape approach integrating abundance censuses, diet, and energy requirements, we investigated the prey consumption patterns of Mediterranean marine megafauna during the summer. We thereby shed light on a diverse guild of species composed of fishes, mammals, reptiles, and birds and estimated that 4.1 million individuals consume 1.6 million tons of prey each summer, pelagic cephalopods being the primary food resource and cetaceans and tunas being key players in the community. Spatial patterns in prey consumption reflected the diverse distribution and needs of the megafauna species and underlined the critical importance of the western Mediterranean for the megafauna community. Conservation strategies should prioritize spatial and biological diversity to safeguard megafauna and ecosystem functions across the Mediterranean basin.},

Simulated extinction scenarios forecast marked declines in functional richness if current trajectories are maintained during the next century (11\% globally; up to 24\% regionally), with more marked reductions (48\% globally; up to 70\% at the poles) beyond random expectations if all threatened species eventually go extinct.

@article{coll_predicting_2019,
	abstract = {The spatial prediction of species distributions from survey data is a significant component of spatial planning and the ecosystem-based management approach to marine resources. Statistical analysis of species occurrences and their relationships with associated environmental factors is used to predict how likely a species is to occur in unsampled locations as well as future conditions. However, it is known that environmental factors alone may not be sufficient to account for species distribution. Other ecological processes including species interactions (such as competition and predation), and the impact of human activities, may affect the spatial arrangement of a species. Novel techniques have been developed to take a more holistic approach to estimating species distributions, such as Bayesian Hierarchical Species Distribution model (B-HSD model) and mechanistic food-web models using the new Ecospace Habitat Foraging Capacity model (E-HFC model). Here we used both species distribution and spatial food-web models to predict the distribution of European hake (Merluccius merluccius), anglerfishes (Lophius piscatorius and L. budegassa) and red mullets (Mullus barbatus and M. surmuletus) in an exploited marine ecosystem of the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We explored the complementarity of both approaches, comparing results of food-web models previously informed with species distribution modelling results, aside from their applicability as independent techniques. The study shows that both modelling results are positively and significantly correlated with observational data. Predicted spatial patterns of biomasses show positive and significant correlations between modelling approaches and are more similar when using both methodologies in a complementary way: when using the E-HFC model previously informed with the environmental envelopes obtained from the B-HSD model outputs, or directly using niche calculations from B-HSD models to drive the niche priors of E-HFC. We discuss advantages, limitations and future developments of both modelling techniques.},

We identified and validated 408 peer-reviewed publications until 2021 following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria. Literature was dominated by marine mammal research conducted in the northern archipelagos (Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands) and marine turtle research conducted in Cabo Verde. Much less research focused on large-bodied fish, especially in Madeira and Canary Islands, leaving some of the most vulnerable species regionally data deficient. Research across scientific disciplines focused more on biological studies than management and policy, and anthropogenic impacts were quantified more frequently on mammals or turtles and less on fishes. By identifying gaps in our knowledge of megafauna in relation to threats faced by these organisms, we offer taxa-specific recommendations for future research direction. Although, overall our results indicate that determining population level connectivity should be a major research priority among many marine megafauna species as this information is vital to numerous management strategies, including marine protected areas. In this review, we present a basis of understanding of the current work in Macaronesia, highlighting critical data gaps that are urgently needed to guide the next steps towards establishing conservation priorities for marine megafauna in the region.},

@article{mcclellan_understanding_2014,
	abstract = {The temperate waters of the North-Eastern Atlantic have a long history of maritime resource richness and, as a result, the European Union is endeavouring to maintain regional productivity and biodiversity. At the intersection of these aims lies potential conflict, signalling the need for integrated, cross-border management approaches. This paper focuses on the marine megafauna of the region. This guild of consumers was formerly abundant, but is now depleted and protected under various national and international legislative structures. We present a meta-analysis of available megafauna datasets using presence-only distribution models to characterise suitable habitat and identify spatially-important regions within the English Channel and southern bight of the North Sea. The integration of studies from dedicated and opportunistic observer programmes in the United Kingdom and France provide a valuable perspective on the spatial and seasonal distribution of various taxonomic groups, including large pelagic fishes and sharks, marine mammals, seabirds and marine turtles. The Western English Channel emerged as a hotspot of biodiversity for megafauna, while species richness was low in the Eastern English Channel. Spatial conservation planning is complicated by the highly mobile nature of marine megafauna, however they are important components of the marine environment and understanding their distribution is a first crucial step toward their inclusion into marine ecosystem management.},

@article{diggle_model-based_1998,
	abstract = {Conventional geostatistical methodology solves the problem of predicting the realized value of a linear functional of a Gaussian spatial stochastic process S(x) based on observations Yi = S(xi) + Zi at sampling locations xi, where the Zi are mutually independent, zero-mean Gaussian random variables. We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The first concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Pacific island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process S(x), observations at sample locations xi form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of S(xi) appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of S(x), making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.},

@article{bradley_bayesian_2016,
	abstract = {We introduce Bayesian spatial change of support (COS) methodology for count-valued survey data with known survey variances. Our proposed methodology is motivated by the American Community Survey (ACS), an ongoing survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides timely information on several key demographic variables. Specifically, the ACS produces 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year ``period-estimates,'' and corresponding margins of errors, for published demographic and socio-economic variables recorded over predefined geographies within the United States. Despite the availability of these predefined geographies, it is often of interest to data-users to specify customized user-defined spatial supports. In particular, it is useful to estimate demographic variables defined on ``new'' spatial supports in ``real-time.'' This problem is known as spatial COS, which is typically performed under the assumption that the data follow a Gaussian distribution. However, count-valued survey data is naturally non-Gaussian and, hence, we consider modeling these data using a Poisson distribution. Additionally, survey-data are often accompanied by estimates of error, which we incorporate into our analysis. We interpret Poisson count-valued data in small areas as an aggregation of events from a spatial point process. This approach provides us with the flexibility necessary to allow ACS users to consider a variety of spatial supports in ``real-time.'' We show the effectiveness of our approach through a simulated example as well as through an analysis using public-use ACS data.},

@article{gelfand_change_2001,
	abstract = {In practice, spatial data are sometimes collected at points (i.e. point-referenced data) and at other times are associated with
areal units (i.e. block data). The change of support problem is concerned with inference about the values of a variable at points
or blocks different from those at which it has been observed. In the
context of block data which can be sensibly viewed as averaging over
point data, we propose a unifying approach for prediction from points
to points, points to blocks, blocks to points, and blocks to blocks.
The approach includes fully Bayesian kriging. We also extend our
approach to the the case of spatio-temporal data, wherein a judicious
specification of spatio-temporal association enables manageable
computation. Exemplification of the static spatial case is provided
using a dataset of point-level ozone measurements in the Atlanta,
Georgia metropolitan area. The dynamic spatial case is illustrated
using a temporally extended version of this dataset, enabling
comparison at the common time point.*To whom correspondence should be

@article{li_log_2012,
	abstract = {This article presents a methodology for modeling aggregated disease incidence data with the spatially continuous log-Gaussian Cox process. Statistical models for spatially aggregated disease incidence data usually assign the same relative risk to all individuals in the same reporting region (census areas or postal regions). A further assumption that the relative risks in two regions are independent given their neighbor's risks (the Markov assumption) makes the commonly used Besag--York--Molli{\'e} model computationally simple. The continuous model proposed here uses a data augmentation step to sample from the posterior distribution of the exact locations at each step of an Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and models the exact locations with an log-Gaussian Cox process. A simulation study shows the log-Gaussian Cox process model consistently outperforming the Besag--York--Molli{\'e} model. The method is illustrated by making inference on the spatial distribution of syphilis risk in North Carolina. The effect of several known social risk factors are estimated, and areas with risk well in excess of that expected given these risk factors are identified.},
